Kiruna municipality is as big as Skåne, Blekinge and Halland combined!



The municipality



The idea of dividing the country into municipalities is to make it easier for us to influence and improve society where we live. 



The people in Sweden's 290 municipalities therefore get to vote for their own local politicians. 



The politicians then decide on common issues within the municipal boundaries.



Municipal council



Approximately once a month, the elected politicians meet in the municipal council to discuss and make decisions. 



The council decides, among other things, how much tax the inhabitants of the municipality should pay and how the tax money should be spent.



The number of politicians on the council ranges from 31 to 101. 



Small municipalities have fewer politicians than large municipalities.



Largest and smallest



The majority decides



In the municipal council, decisions are made according to the majority principle. 



In other words, for a proposal to win, it must receive at least half of the votes.

Power of attorney



Power of attorney means that a person has been given the right to decide for someone else.



The municipality's politicians have been given power of attorney by the voters to make decisions concerning their municipality. 



This is why they are called councillors.
