The class trip



The class has been raising money together since third grade.



They have organized a disco, a flea market and sold bread and coconut balls.



But I ate most of the balls myself! says Plätten happily. 



Plätten's parents had to pay for his little private party.



Now it's time to decide what to do with the money in the class fund. 



There's a whopping 43,000 kronor! Four different proposals are on the blackboard. 



Of course, they vote on the issue. The result is as follows:



LISEBERG



mountain friends



Go to Denmark, go camping



(everyone pays 500kr)



stay at home, share the rest



“It's not fair!” says Rickard, who wanted to go hiking in the mountains. 



“Only 10 people want to go to Liseberg. 



It's actually a minority in the class. 



Should they get to decide over the rest of us?



Plätten agrees:



It's better if we just hand out the money, so everyone has the freedom to choose for themselves. 



My parents have paid for the coconut balls. 



Then at least my share of the money should go to things I like to do! Or should it?
