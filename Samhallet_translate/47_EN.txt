Television, radio, newspapers and the internet are known as the mass media.



The mass media have a lot of power over what we are told about the world, and what we think about it. 



“Ida, dv thinks the world seems horrible, because the news is usually about horrible things” says mom. 



“But is it really that bad?” When people join together in associations, 



they can have more impact than if they work alone. 



Ida's mother is a member of Save the Children. 



It is an organization that works to ensure that all children in the world have a safe childhood. 



There are thousands of organizations in Sweden, with different focuses and goals.



They all have an impact on our society.



Knowledge is power, as the saying goes. 



Inventors, researchers and other experts have knowledge of things that few other people know about. 



By developing new medicines, faster computers and other inventions, they have a huge potential to change the world. 



“They can invent terrible things too,” says Ida, ”like bombs and poison!”



Look at the different people in power on this spread. 



Who do you think has the most power in society?



Are there some who should have less power? Why do you think so?
