Robin tells us



I'm glad I didn't go to prison.



The social services lady talked to my mom and me several times. 



It was quite hard. 



But then they arranged for me to get in touch with Bengt and his family. 



They live in the countryside outside LÃ¶vsta. They are my contact family now. 



I live there at weekends, so I can't hang out in town as much anymore.



Bengt keeps an eye on me, you could say.



Then I get to help at the theater with light and sound on stage.



I'll work there without pay for two weeks. It's called community service. 



But it's really fun! I think I want to work in the theater when I get older.



Honestly, I don't know why we hit that kiosk.



It just felt exciting. 



I've done stupid things before too that I didn't get caught for. Assault and battery and stuff.



It probably started when I hung out with Micke and his friends in town. 



They were used to theft and stuff. We had nothing else to do. 



It felt good to be with Micke. 



He taught me a lot, both good and bad. 



I don't have a father at home, so it was nice to talk to an older guy sometimes. 



It's common for young people to commit crimes in gangs.



Few commit crimes on their own. Why do you think that is?
