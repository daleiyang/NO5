Morals and other rules



Some rules are based on our conscience and morals. 



Stealing from a friend, cheating or bullying can make you feel guilty all over again. 



We call it a guilty conscience when we feel this way. 



We feel ashamed of what we have done.



The reason we feel guilty is because of our morals.



Our morals are like internal rules. 



Morality tells us how we should behave towards other people.



Many people believe that everyone in the world has the same sense of what is morally right and wrong.



Other words for morality are ethics and values.



The golden rule



Many wise people have tried to describe human morality in a few words. 



The Golden Rule is probably the best attempt to find a moral rule that applies to everyone.



The Golden Rule says that we should always treat other people the way we want to be treated. 



Then we will rarely do anything that feels immoral or wrong.



It's a pretty good rule, isn't it? 



The Golden Rule is about an important moral quality of human beings: 



We can put ourselves in other people's shoes. 



It's called compassion or empathy.



Jesus used the Golden Rule in his sermons 2000 years ago.



Whatever you want people to do for you, 



you should also do for them



500 years before Jesus, the Chinese thinker Confucius said the same thing, but in different words.



Don't do anything to others that you don't want them to do to you
