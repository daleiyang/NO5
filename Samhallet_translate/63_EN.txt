The courts judge 



Through a trial, the court decides whether the suspected criminal is guilty. 



The prosecutor and the suspect are then allowed to give their views on what happened. 



During the trial, the suspect is called the defendant. 



The court then decides whether to acquit or convict the accused of the crime. 



The decision is written down in the form of a judgment. 



The judgment also states the punishment to be given to the guilty party. 



Both the prosecutor and the convicted person can appeal the judgment.



The case can then be retried. 



The prosecutor is sometimes dissatisfied because the sentence was too lenient. 



The convicted person, on the other hand, may want another chance to prove his or her innocence, or receive a lighter sentence.



The Criminal Code is a section of the law book.



It describes the different types of crimes and how the courts should sentence a person who has committed a particular crime.



The courts cannot make up their own sentences.



The prosecutor tries to prove that the suspect is guilty of the crime through the indictment.



The judge presides over the trial.



He or she decides whether the defendant is guilty or not.



The defense counsel helps the defendant so that he or she is not unfairly convicted.



The defense counsel is often called a lawyer.



Both the prosecution and the defense can call witnesses.



These are people who know something about the events. 2



If the court is not sure, it should acquit rather than convict the defendant.



Do you think this is a good rule?
