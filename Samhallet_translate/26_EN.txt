Your economy



Economics is about how we use our money and other resources to get food, 



clothes and other things we need. 



The goal of a person who is economical is to fulfill their most important needs and desires without using more resources than necessary. 



Resources are all the things we can use to fulfill our wants and needs. Example: 



money and valuables 



work



knowledge



tools and machines



raw materials (wood, iron ore, oil, and other things we can use to make things)



Our needs are food, housing, clothes and other things we need to live. 



We also have many other wants: toys, nice cars, vacations and more.



Budget



If you want to keep track of your money, you can make a budget. 



In the budget, you decide how the money will be spent in a given month. 



How much money should you spend on sweets, movies, magazines, etc. And how much can you save?



Monthly or weekly allowance?



Rickard has a monthly allowance of SEK 80, but wants SEK 20 a week instead.



“Sure!” says his father. “That's the same amount per month.”



“You think so”, Rickard thinks happily. 



Can you figure out what Rickard earns from the deal?
