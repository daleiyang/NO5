The Riksdag



Issues that affect the whole of Sweden are decided by the Riksdag.



The 349 politicians in the Riksdag are elected by voters from all parts of the country. 



In this way, it can be said that the Riksdag truly represents all the Swedish people.



How the Riksdag is formed



The people vote: Sweden has a high voter turnout. 



On election day, about 8 out of 10 eligible voters go to the polling station to vote.



Seats in the Riksdag are allocated: To enter the Riksdag, a party must receive at least 4% of the votes (just over 200,000 votes). 



The party that gets the most votes also gets the most seats in Parliament.



Once the seats are allocated, the parties discuss how they will cooperate. 



Just like in the municipality, parties from the same block usually stick together to get a majority.
