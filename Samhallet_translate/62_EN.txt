Law and justice



Politicians in Parliament decide what laws should apply in society. 



The police and the courts then ensure that the laws are obeyed and that justice is done when a crime has been committed.



The police keep order



The police are happy to provide information on how we can protect ourselves against violence, theft and other crimes. 



In this way, they prevent crimes from happening. This is called crime prevention.



Patrolling the streets is another way to prevent crime - but 



few people dare to break the law if they know the police might see them. 



When someone does break the law, the police can arrest the criminal and lock him up temporarily in a cell at the remand center. 



The detention center is often located near the police station. 



The suspected criminal is held there for a short time until the prosecutor can investigate the case.



The police can issue a fine directly to a person who has committed a minor offense, 



such as riding a bicycle without lights.



The prosecutor



The prosecutor decides what to do with a person suspected of having committed a crime.



The prosecutor investigates the case and then decides whether the suspect should be released, 



punished directly with a fine, or if the crime is serious enough to be prosecuted. 



Prosecution means that the crime will be tried by a court.
