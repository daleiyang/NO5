In order to get the majority of votes, parties usually work together. 



Parties belonging to the same bloc usually stick together to win the votes.



The opposition speaks out



Parties that are in the minority form the opposition. 



The opposition works hard, even though they almost never win any votes. 



They want to show that they have better proposals than the parties in the majority. 



If the opposition succeeds, more voters will vote for them in the next election.



The history of municipalities



More than 1,000 years ago, Christian congregations began to form in Sweden. 



They built churches that people went to. 



Those who went to the same church belonged to the same parish. (The word 'parish' means 'seeking').



The people in the parish helped run the church and looked after the weak and poor of the community. 



From the 18th century, the parish also organized literacy classes.



In 1862, Parliament decided that the municipalities should take over the tasks of the parishes. 



Schools and helping the poor are still the most important tasks of municipalities.
