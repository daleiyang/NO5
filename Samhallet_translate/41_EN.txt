and implements



The Government must also ensure that Parliament's decisions are implemented. 



If Parliament decides that the country's prisons should be made safer, it is the Government's job to implement the decision.



The Government can then ensure that old prisons are rebuilt and that more prison officers are employed.



To really implement everything that the Parliament and the Government decide, the state must employ police officers, soldiers, employment officers and other civil servants. 



They work in different agencies. 



The authorities have the power to decide for the people, but everything they do must be supported by laws and other decisions made by politicians.



It is the Riksdag that decides in Sweden, but the government also has great power.



How can the government influence the decisions of the Riksdag?



What does the King do?



To govern means to direct and control something. 



In the past, it was the King who ruled the country, and he was then called the country's regent. 



When Sweden became a democracy at the beginning of the 20th century, the King lost his power because he is not elected by the people.



The king is still called Sweden's head of state and his salary comes from taxpayers' money. 



He travels around the world promoting Sweden. 



And he helps out when Sweden is visited by important people from abroad.



King Carl XVI Gustaf is also Sweden's head of state.



When the government presents a proposal to the Riksdag, it is called a bill.



Politicians in the Riksdag can also submit their own proposals. 



Such a proposal is called a motion.
