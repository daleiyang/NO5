Freedom on the right



The parties on the right want more freedom for each person to decide about their life. 



Politicians should not decide so much for us. 



The right therefore wants to reduce the public sector and lower taxes. 



If taxes are lowered, there will be more private money left in the wallet that each person can decide for themselves. 



This would benefit society as a whole, according to the Right. 



Common goals



Politics is not always about battles between right and left. 



All parties are in favor of democracy, human rights and freedoms, and equality. 



These are examples of issues on which the parties can agree, even though they belong to different blocs



Both the left and the right work hard to create a good society to live in. 



Why do you think they find it so difficult to agree?



The alliance



The parties on the right are often called the Alliance or the Conservatives. 



They include the Center Party, the People's Party, the Moderates and the Christian Democrats.



The color of the Conservatives is blue. 



If we are allowed to make more decisions ourselves, our freedom will increase. 



We will then take more responsibility for our lives!



Center Party



There should be good opportunities to live and work in the countryside too!



People's Party



Raise teachers' salaries and improve schools!



The Moderates



Lower taxes for companies and there will be more jobs!



Christian Democrats



Let families decide more about kindergarten and school!
