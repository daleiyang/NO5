Injustice and oppression



Dictatorship often leads to injustice. 



The dictator accumulates great wealth and power for himself and his friends. 



The rest of the people are left to live in poverty, with no say in how society is run.



The dictator is often afraid that his people will rebel against the injustices and take power away from him. 



Therefore, the dictator does everything to control the people, so that no one can or dares to protest.



No free elections In a democracy, the people have a say through votes and elections. 



But the dictator does not like free elections. 



If he organizes a vote, he will tamper with the result if necessary.



Censorship and repression of opinion People are forbidden to express their opinions. 



This is called repression of opinion. 



Censorship means that the dictator and his henchmen control the country's TV, radio and newspapers so that nothing critical is reported about them.



Reign of terror The military and police are used to intimidate people into silence. 



Anyone who complains or disobeys risks being thrown in prison and severely punished. 



In the worst cases, they are tortured or executed.



Few dare to protest in a dictatorship. 



Can we expect everyone to be as brave as the protester in the picture on the left?



The dictator is often a senior military officer (colonel or general), who takes power in his country with the help of his soldiers.
