Tips for the eEconomist. 



What can you do if you are always short of money? Here are some tips:



1. decide which needs and wants are most important.



Focus on them first (this is called prioritizing).



2. use as few resources as possible to fulfill your needs and wants. 



Buy cheap and don't waste!



3. save money to buy things later that you cannot afford right away. 



Borrowing money to buy things is expensive because you have to pay interest on the money. 



Interest is a fee you pay to borrow money from the bank or other companies.



4. think about whether you can increase your resources. 



Could you increase your allowance, sell something, or work extra at home?



Or maybe you can make what you want yourself - then you use yourself as a resource instead of money!



What can you do if you don't have enough money for everything you want?
