DisCrimination 



Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for people to be treated unfairly because of their skin color, age, 



their gender (whether they are a boy or a girl), because they use a wheelchair, or have hearing problems. 



When someone is treated badly because of such personal characteristics, it is called discrimination.



Parliament has passed several laws that prohibit discrimination, bullying and other injustices that violate human rights. 



Examples of injustices that Parliament has prohibited



not getting a job in the shop just because she wants to wear a scarf. 



The scarf is very important to Mira, because of her religion.



Lisa and Ida are in love, but they are not allowed to kiss at school just because they are girls.



Erik doesn't dare go to school because he is bullied, and none of the adults at school help him.



Eva is paid less than Frank just because she is a girl.



The principal said IsaK couldn't go on the school trip because it would be difficult to take IsaK's wheelchair.



Do you think human rights really protect all people?
