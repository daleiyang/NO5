Politics and parties



Politicians come together in parties



A political party is a kind of association. 



It brings together people with similar views on what society should look like.



They work together to implement the party's ideas.



Parties publish party programs. 



These state what the party thinks about schools, healthcare, businesses and other important social issues.



Party members appoint a few people to lead the party and stand for election. 



These leaders are called politicians.



Before the elections



Every four years, the Swedish people choose the politicians who will govern the country. 



Voters then vote for the party whose program best matches their own views.



Before the election, the parties run election campaigns. 



They organize meetings, debate politicians from other parties and appear extensively on television, newspapers and radio. 



They do everything they can to explain how their party wants to improve society 



and why people should vote for them.



Politics? It's just talk, nagging and boring old men deciding idiotic things!



So I don't bother voting!



In a democracy, it is possible to replace bad politicians and change the leadership of society by going to vote. 



The couch potato should think about that!
