Council of Ministers and Parliament



When decisions need to be made in the EU, politicians from member governments travel to Brussels, the capital of Belgium. 



There, they meet in the EU Council of Ministers, which is made up of ministers from all EU countries.



When decisions are taken on agriculture, it is the agriculture ministers who meet. 



When it comes to the environment, the environment ministers meet. 



So there are different ministers in the Council depending on what the meeting is about. 



Before the Swedish ministers go to the Council to make decisions, they have first asked what the Riksdag thinks.



Some decisions are taken by the Council of Ministers together with the Parliament. 



The Parliament acts as the EU's own parliament. 



It is made up of 736 politicians elected every 5 years by the people of the EU. 18 of them are Swedish.



How far do you think cooperation in Europe can go? 



Should we have a common military and the same laws in all countries?



The EU currently has around 500 million inhabitants in 27 countries, and more countries may soon join the Union. 



From the beginning, only 6 countries were part of the cooperation.
