Crimes and penalties



Anyone guilty of a crime can be punished with a fine or imprisonment. 



Fines are the most common and mean that the criminal must pay a sum of money to society. 



Life imprisonment is the most severe punishment in Sweden today.



Why punish?



In the past, punishment was used to take revenge on the offender. 



Serious crimes could be punished by death.



Today, society does not primarily want to take revenge on the criminal. 



The cruelest punishments are therefore gone. 



But punishments should still be a deterrent enough to prevent people from committing crimes.



Putting serious criminals in prison is also a way to protect society 



- the criminal will hopefully not be able to commit new crimes as long as he is locked up.



The prison system



More often than not, society tries to help the convicted criminal instead of just punishing him.



This help is called correctional care.



Correctional services provide support and education so that the convicted person can start an honest life.



This benefits both the convicted person and society.



More than half of all prisoners abuse drugs or alcohol. 



The Prison and Probation Service tries to help prisoners become drug-free.



This gives them a much better chance of getting their lives back on track.



Facts about the death penalty



69 countries still have the death penalty.



In 2008, at least 2,390 people were executed and over 8,000 were sentenced to death. 



In Sweden, the death penalty was abolished in 1921.



Those sentenced to life imprisonment in Sweden are usually pardoned after 15-20 years. 



The sentence is then considered to have been served.



Corporal punishment, severed hands and decapitation were once used as punishments in Sweden.



At that time, people believed in revenge and deterrence.
