THE INFORMATION SOCIETY



Never before in history has there been so much information around us. 



This is why our era is often referred to as the 'information society'. 



Every day you encounter thousands of messages that want to inform, entertain or influence you. 



And some of them actually want to deceive you! 



It is therefore very important that you learn to distinguish between different types of information:



Facts and information materials have the main goal of giving you new knowledge that you can really trust.



Examples of information material are school books, encyclopedias and notices from the municipality, the police and other authorities.



The news tells us about important events in the world that we need to know about. 



Good news serves as facts and information. 



It aims to give us true and reliable knowledge. 



But you can't trust everything that is written of course!



Advertising wants us to buy products from a particular company.



In other words, the purpose of advertising is to influence you, to make you want to buy a certain type of hamburger, certain clothes or games.



Propaganda and political advertising aim to influence how you think and feel about important issues. 



For example, political parties use opinion pieces, 



and political advertising to get voters to vote for them on election day.
