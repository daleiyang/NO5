Otto and the main thing



There is a new law requiring all children under 15 to wear a bicycle helmet.



But what about the adults? They hardly have tin heads!



says wise Otto. Shouldn't their heads be protected too?



Ida and Otto spot Rolf, the woodwork teacher, riding his bike to school at an insane pace - without a helmet.



Check it out! He's very careful about safety on the band saw, but on the bike he's a deadly danger, says Otto.



The law must be changed! Ida says. They write a letter to the local newspaper: 



Now the parliament has actually missed an important point. 



Did you know that more adults than children are seriously injured in bicycle accidents?



The law on bicycle helmets should apply to adults too - their heads are just as fragile as children's. 



Greetings from Ida and Otto



Bengt-Ola is a Member of Parliament. He lives in Lövsta and reacts quickly to the children's letters. 



In a motion to the Riksdag, he proposes that the government should investigate how the helmet law actually works.



The Riksdag votes yes to Bengt-Ola's motion. 



The issue is thus handed over to the Government for investigation.



The Prime Minister understands that the issue is important. 



She herself always wears a helmet when she cycles to work.



“Investigate this further,” the Prime Minister tells the Transport Minister.
