WHO SHOULD DECIDE?



Private matters



There are 28 students in Ida's class. 



But it is almost only in the classroom that they stick together in a group. 



At break time, they quickly split up into groups of friends depending on what they want to do. 



Some run out into the schoolyard to play soccer. Others sit down to play cards and talk. 



Each student decides for himself or herself how to spend the break. It is a private matter. 



Ida's gang gathers in the recreation room. 



They still haven't found a good solution to who will decide in their new community.



I think we should decide together!



I think that whoever is strongest should decide everything.



Then there won't be so much talk!



It gets messy if everyone has to decide. 



We will never be in complete agreement.



I think the wisest people should make the decisions!



The boys have always been allowed to decide before. 



Now the girls should decide everything for a while!
