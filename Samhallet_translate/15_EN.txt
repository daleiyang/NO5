Sweden's path to democracy



Today, Sweden and most other countries in Europe are democracies. 



But it wasn't long ago that only the king, the nobility and other rich men decided everything in the country. 



Until 1909, the number of votes depended on how wealthy you were. 



The more money a person had - the more votes he had.



Women and poor men had no right to vote. 



It was not until 1921 that women were allowed to vote in Sweden. 



This meant that all adult citizens had the opportunity to participate in elections.



Today we have one vote each in democratic elections - all people are equally valuable.



Then a few wealthy people had power over the rest of the people.



What do the constitutions say?



The constitution is the most important law in Swedish society.



They state that “all power is vested in the people”. 



The constitution also states what freedoms and rights we have.



Freedom of opinion We can think and feel as we like. 



No one can be punished for their opinions or forced to think a certain way.



Freedom of assembly Everyone can hold meetings and demonstrations.



Freedom of the press and freedom of expression Everyone can publish newspapers, create websites, speak on the radio or television to express their opinions.



Freedom of association We can work with other people in associations and parties.



Freedom of religion Everyone has the right to practice their religion freely.
