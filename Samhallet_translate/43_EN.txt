The Transport Minister commissions a group of experts to find out how many adults are injured because they don't wear a helmet.



The experts conclude that the law should be changed - adults should wear helmets too!



The government meets to discuss.



The report's proposal is quite cheap to implement, says the finance minister happily.



And hospitals would not have to treat so many adult cyclists with head injuries, the Minister of Social Affairs points out.



The Prime Minister thinks about it.



This sounds good, she says. The government decides to submit a bill to Parliament. 



It proposes that all cyclists should wear helmets.



The proposal is discussed at length in Parliament. 



The opposition thinks that adults should actually be free to decide for themselves whether or not to wear a helmet. 



Otherwise they might stop cycling and drive more instead.



â€œHelmet or no helmet - that's a purely private matter that we politicians should not interfere with! says a man from the opposition.



The government party does not have its own majority in parliament.



But they have the support of two other parties. 



Together, they have a majority and can pass the law on bicycle helmets for adults.



The Minister of Transport makes sure everyone is informed about the new law through TV, radio and newspapers. 



He also contacts the police, who are tasked with informing schools and workplaces about the law.



Good, thinks Otto. Now we don't have to worry about Roffe any more. 



Sometimes adults don't know better!



Do you think it's possible for children to influence politics the way Ida and Otto did?



Can you think of other ways to influence decisions in the Riksdag?
