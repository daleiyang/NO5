Municipalities' tasks



Most of the money collected by municipalities through taxes is used for social services, kindergartens and schools. 



Parliament has decided that each municipality must carry out these tasks.



Social services



Social services are intended to help people who have difficulty coping in society.



People who have problems with alcohol or other drugs can get support from the social services so that they can stop using them. 



Those who don't have a job can get benefits so they can afford food and rent.



Elderly and disabled people get help with cooking, cleaning and going to the shops.



Social services also look after children and young people who have problems in their family or who are at risk of getting involved in drugs or crime.
