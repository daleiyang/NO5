The power



Ida watches the news with her mother. 



It's the same as always: war, famine and other misery.



The world is horrible and unfair, Ida complains. 



They should replace all the politicians. 



Then maybe we can have a new, better world!



Do you think politicians have that much power? says mom, surprised. 



There are many others who influence how the world looks! 



Look here and you'll see ... Ida's mother draws a mind map showing the people in power in society.



Politicians, of course, have great power over the public part of society. 



They can make laws that we have to follow, and they decide how much tax we have to pay. 



But remember, it is the people who elect and dismiss politicians!



Companies make the food, clothes and other things we need.



“Yeah, right!” Ida says.



“What if there were no shops, or factories! 



How would I get chocolate ice cream then?” 



“And where else would my pay come from?” Mom adds.



It's clear that companies and their owners play a big role for all people.



We are influenced by those who make movies, music, books, fashion and other culture. 



Artists and performers can give us new ideas, or create trends that everyone suddenly wants to follow.
