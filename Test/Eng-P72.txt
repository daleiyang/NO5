00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.330
Unit four,

1
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.989
page 72 exercise f

2
00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:06.869
listening activity.

3
00:00:07.699 --> 00:00:08.670
What am I?

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.600
You are going to hear some things describe what they are.

5
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.970
After each description.

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.299
You have to guess what the thing is and draw it on the paper in front of you.

7
00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:22.840
Number one,

8
00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:26.299
you need me to play this sport.

9
00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:32.439
I try to hit a small white plastic ball over a net and onto the other side of a table,

10
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.000
use me to serve or smash the ball and if you're good enough, you can score points.

11
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.919
I look like a big flat lollipop, but I don't taste nice at all.

12
00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:44.799
What am I?

13
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.790
Number two?

14
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.299
I am a small thing.

15
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.360
Put me in your pocket and no one can see me

16
00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:00.860
most of the time. I'm as quiet as a mouse. Although I'm not a mouse,

17
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.900
I can help you see in the dark. Although I am not a lamp,

18
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.970
I can tell you what time it is. Although I'm not a clock,

19
00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:12.760
I can wake you up. Although I'm not your mum or dad,

20
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.260
I can play games with you. Although I'm not a dog,

21
00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:20.639
I can send messages for you. Although I'm not a postman,

22
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.199
I can help you to talk to people. Although I'm not a microphone.

23
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.550
What am I?

24
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.480
Number three?

25
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.099
I am black and then I am white,

26
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.580
then black again

27
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.569
and then white, black, white, black, white. That's me.

28
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.069
I'm not a chameleon.

29
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.180
I'm more like a zebra.

30
00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:50.830
Maybe you think I'm boring. But I'm important for so many people.

31
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.169
I can stop cars, buses and motorcycles.

32
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.669
All you have to do is stand next to me and traffic waits for you.

33
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.169
When you get to the other side of me,

34
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.370
my magic stops working and the traffic drives over me.

35
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.919
What am I?

36
00:02:09.788 --> 00:02:10.850
Number four?

37
00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:13.800
I normally live in a box.

38
00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:18.410
If you want to see me, then you must wait until I come out at night.

39
00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.059
I don't have eyes or ears or a tail.

40
00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:23.809
But be careful with me.

41
00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:26.139
I don't have teeth or claws,

42
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.990
but I can be dangerous.

43
00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:31.809
Animals don't like me because I scare them.

44
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.570
Ask an adult to put me in the ground.

45
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.330
I cannot run away,

46
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.559
but I can fly even though I have no wings

47
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.740
light me like a candle stand back and wait

48
00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:50.869
when I'm ready, I'll make a loud noise and show you my colors.

49
00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.990
So

50
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.300
when can you see me

51
00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:57.750
bonfire night? And New Year's Eve are the best times.

52
00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.889
What am I?
