I HAVE STARTED playing table tennis. I have made friends. 



I have a new mom and a new dad, and new siblings.



Every night I Skype with my real mom. 



I tell her that everything is great, that everyone is nice and that I fit in. 



Mom says that sounds nice, but I know her so well that I know she's disappointed. 



Sick, stupid mom. She doesn't know any better than to be jealous. 



That's how it's always been, that when I've done things that haven't worked for her, she gets quiet. 



She gets quieter and quieter on skype. 



I imagine that she gets stiffer and has more pain, without telling me. 



In any case, her hair is getting dirtier.



She complains about the assistants who cook disgusting food and that they can't clean. 



I try not to worry too much. 



But when it gets too much, I sneak out the door, through the garden and into the grove behind the house.
