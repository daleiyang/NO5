He said that it might be good to get some experience in racing, and that this is a real “folk festival”. 



Alvar reminded him of how it went last year, to hell. 



It doesn't matter if you win or not, Mange said, as long as you do your best. 



Alvar eventually gave up. 



Maybe he felt that Mange, who had worked so long on the competition, should have at least one of his children there.



People from all over the county come to Bokarp. 



Everyone has tracksuits in different colors with the club's name on the back. 



I'm excited to see so many new people jumping out of the minibuses. 



In the cafeteria, I start talking to a family that has traveled twenty miles to join us. 



All three children play table tennis, the father was apparently also good at it once. 



They tell me how often they compete - almost every weekend -- 



and I ask them how they can stand doing the same thing all the time. 



The father doesn't seem to understand the question.



Evin and the others are also going to play.



It's unclear what they think of me. 



I'm not ostracized, but I'm not invited to anyone's house after school either. 



Sometimes I notice Evin looking at me in the classroom. 



When I look back, she turns her head away.



Evin and I are scheduled to stand together in the cafeteria. 



At first it's a bit awkward. 



We make sandwiches and put buns on plates in a neat way.
