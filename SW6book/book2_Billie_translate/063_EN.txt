If you talk about your feelings, you can learn things about yourself.”



What kind of things?”



I suddenly remember when the psychologist made my mother remember that my grandmother had never said anything nice to her. 



Why you're sad, for example. There could be lots of reasons.”



He looks away. I imagine there are things going on in his head.

I've been seeing a psychologist,” I say. “I got to talk about all the bad stuff with my mom. It was quite fun?



Fun?”



It's fun to talk about yourself.”



Alvar gapes. “Is it?”



I nod.



He opens the door to his room. I step in, even though he hasn't invited me in. 



The room looks like any other boy's room. There is a bed and a desk. 



There are some medals hanging on a hook and in the bookcase is a book about fishing that he probably got as a Christmas present from Mange. Nothing else.



Alvar and I will never be friends.



Alvar has never experienced anything. 



He has never thought a critical thought, laughed out loud, sung too loudly or talked to himself.
