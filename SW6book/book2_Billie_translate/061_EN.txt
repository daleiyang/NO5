Maybe she's just out for a stroll,” I say.



Petra and Mange look at me uncomprehendingly.



“Strolling?” asks Mange. “No, I don't think so.”



Everyone needs to be alone and think sometimes. Everyone needs time to philosophize.”



They can't even pretend to listen to me.



In the end, they decide to start eating anyway.



I sit down in my place on the edge. Mange manages a fake smile. 



Now it is important not to get excited.”



As if they hadn't already done so.



Mange has made a vegetarian lasagna with cottage cheese and peas that tastes anything but lasagna. 



I'm dying for Thai food, but I'm not going to ask yet if it's available anywhere. 



There are many things I'm not going to ask, like why Mange has to pretend he knows everything. 



Yesterday he knew everything about hunting. 



Today he's rattling off match statistics in some ping-pong league when no one is the least bit interested. 



He reminds me of the most annoying boys in class, who always need attention. 



I almost feel sorry for him.



In the middle of dinner we hear the front door open.



Mange and Petra rush to the hall. I hear them talking in excited voices.



But where have you been?”



Where have you been, Tea? Answer me now.”



Alvar makes a little, little face at me. 



I hope it means he thinks Petra and Mange are exaggerating.
