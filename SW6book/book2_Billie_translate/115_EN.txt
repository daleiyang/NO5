with servants and a strict mother who reminds me of Snow White's wicked stepmother. 



I have taken a break from thinking about the Persson family for the moment, stopped sniffing for moods in the brown house. 



I sit down in the right place at the dining table, 



eat my muesli, drink water from my cup and brush my teeth at quarter to nine. 



I do the right thing and hope for a miracle: that everything will feel completely natural. 



But in the evening, from the window of my room, I see Petra watering the little tree 



and I can't help but wonder what's going on anyway.



Tea was waiting for Nadine outside the schoolyard the day after we talked. 



She followed her to the bus stop and got on the same bus as her. 



Nadine got off on the highway a few kilometers from Bokarp and walked ten minutes on a dirt road straight into the forest.



Tea did the same, and photographed the sign with the road name on it. 



When I got the photo proof, I linked to Miss Pinky's makeup videos everywhere I could.



I guess I wanted people at home to think I'd gone mad.



I even asked my mom to look at Tea's videos.



She got worried - about me. “You can't be like that, Billie. Promise me.” 



Other days, she's afraid I'm going to turn into a commoner. 



“As long as you don't come home and become boring.” 



I haven't had the courage to tell her that I put the bedspread on myself every morning.
