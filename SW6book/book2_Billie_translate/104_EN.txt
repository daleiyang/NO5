The people have real faces, eyes that express emotions. 



It's almost eerie. The clay figures are beautiful, with amazing detail. 



Alvar must have spent hundreds of hours to make so many.



What will you do with them?” I ask.

He frowns. “What? No.”



Yes! They're gorgeous.”



He snorts and lets his bangs fall down.

Alvar shakes his head. “This is just for me.”



Your army.”



He turns his eyes to me and nods. “My army.”



In the evening, I can't stop thinking about Alvar. 



I think it's awful that Petra and Mange say that he's “tinkering”, without knowing anything more. 



Actually, I should talk to them, but we don't have that contact.



Petra knocks on my door and wants to give me a goodnight hug. 



Her body hurts against my collarbone. Her hand feels cold against my forehead.



I understand if it's hard with everything new,” she says.
