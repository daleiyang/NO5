Or a collar. But I know nothing about god stuff.”



Petra swallows and smiles like that. “I don't usually wear a collar. 



But I do have a little cross.” 



She runs her finger along her neck and pulls out a thin chain that has ended up under her sweater. “Here.”



Mange takes my bag. 



I let him do it, because I can tell it's important to him. 



Cecilia and I get into the back seat. 



It smells fresh and there are no candy wrappers anywhere. 



I'm afraid I'll get the light-colored seats dirty and fold my hands in my lap just in case.



As the car drives out of what still looks like a town, I remember that it is not where the Persson family lives. 



It would be another couple of miles to the community where the house is located.



“How long have you lived in Bokarp?” I ask.



“Eleven years,” Petra replies. “We moved there when Alvar was one.”



“What's good about living there?”



Petra turns to me. Her eyes are really unnaturally big. 



“That it's quiet and nice. And that you know everyone.”



“What's good about knowing everyone?”



She glances at Mange, but he just keeps driving.



“Well... I guess it feels safe”



“What's good about feeling safe?”



“Billie!”
