Then Tea comes into the kitchen with her mouth agape. 



Mange and Petra continue to talk about what she has done and where she has been. 



Eventually it emerges that she has been at Fatima's house on Solkullen. 



Petra and Mange look at each other in dismay.



I try to convince myself that the Persson family is normal. 



In normal families, you're probably worried like this. 



In normal families, rules are important. 



You don't go to a friend's house unless you've asked your parents, and you don't be late for dinner. 



At the same time, the feeling in her body is that something is wrong. 



Why is Petra so afraid of people who live on Solkullen? She's so nice to everyone she meets. 



It would be terrible if that goodness isn't real, if she's really fake and she's just playing nice.



After eating, Tea goes to her room. 



Alvar asks if he can leave the table and he agrees. 



I follow him up the stairs. 



Not that I mind, but his jeans aren't exactly stylish.



'Your parents need therapy,' I say outside his room.



He turns around. “Therapy?”



Yeah, it's when you talk about your feelings with a professional.”



Alvar looks completely blank.
