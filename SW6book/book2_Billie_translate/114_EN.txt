MANGE has bought a bicycle for me from a neighbor.



The bike shines in red and looks brand new. 



I carefully get on it and pedal away. 



Soon it's as if I've never done anything but ride a bike. 



I am as fast as I can be and as smart as I can be, knowing exactly when to slow down or pull over. 



In Bokarp, people have had bicycles for as long as they've been able to walk. 



I've only owned one in my whole life, a black one. 



My mom bought it when I was maybe six, but she was in a wheelchair even then so we could never ride together. 



It took at least a year before a friend's mom taught me to ride a bike. 



By then I was already too big for the black bike.



I set off on a long trip to spy on Nadine. 



On the way, I fantasize about all sorts of things to do with Nadine, like her living in a castle and asking if I can leave the table.
