After school,” Nadine continues. “See you in the tunnel.”



In class, Evin and Filippa end up on the same team. 



Evin, who is the best at ball sports, scores one goal after another. 



Filippa gives her perfect passes. 



They dribble me away easily and high five me after every goal. 



After the game, they hug and shout that they are going to win the World Handball Championship.



Evin continues to giggle with Filippa when we change. 



It's like I've become invisible to her.



Mickis and a few others want to talk to me, but I'm not interested. 



When Filippa disappears into the bathroom



Evin sneaks close and asks what Nadine wanted earlier.



I suddenly don't know what I want. If I don't give a shit about Evin.



maybe I can at least be friends with Nadine.



But there's nothing to say that will happen. 



I glance at Nadine where she stands so serious and snaps on her necklace. 



Do I want to be friends with her?



I'm going crazy for Filippa!” Evins lips touch my cheek. 



She clings to me like a band-aid. I want to be with people who aren't like everyone else.”



It gets all warm inside. 



In the next moment, I've told her that Nadine and I are meeting after school. 



Evin puts an arm around my waist. 



Now we will know everything. And it's all thanks to you!”



In the afternoon, I cycle towards the pedestrian tunnel under the main road.
