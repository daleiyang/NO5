They squirm and giggle, but not in a way that feels mean.



“So you don't know Alvar?



I met him for the first time yesterday,” I say,



but I'm sure we'll get to know each other soon because we live in the same house.” 



A whistle is heard. Alvar looks down at the floor. 



His neck is so red it looks burnt.



But I'm not here to spend time with Alvar,” I add. 



Because I don't want them to think I just want to be with him.



You can sit next to me because Filippa is sick,” says the dark girl. “I'm Evin, by the way.”



I nod. A moment later, the lady arrives. 



She has a pierced nose and bright red hair.



Are you Billie?”



I nod. The lady extends her hand.



My name is Roya.”



Roya doesn't look at all like the image I have of the teacher in Bokarp. 



But I'm not exactly disappointed.



Now she unlocks the door and I follow Evin into the classroom. Two boys are pushed a little. 



The mischievous one who felt my hair first says shut up to the other.



We don't talk like that here, Douglas.”



After I sit down, I sneak a peek at the class. Most of them look friendly, thankfully. 



You wouldn't know if Bokarp was a place where people just longed to bully a newcomer.
