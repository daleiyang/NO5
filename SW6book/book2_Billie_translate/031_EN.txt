I HAVE UNPACKED my stuff, but it still doesn't look like my room. 



It's far too white and far too big. 



I pull off the bedspread and make a mess of the bed. 



I put the toiletries all over the shelf. 



I take down one length of red curtain and tie it around the ceiling light, 



and I put the other one on the big white desk, like a tablecloth. 



I turn on the lamp, which casts a red glow over the walls. 



It becomes more cozy. But there's nothing I can do about the cold.



Surely I will get used to it. I'm sure you can get used to anything. 



It's just that the Persson family in Bokarp live so differently from me. 



Normally I only talk to one person when I come home from school. 



Now I'm going to live with four others, have dinner and watch TV with them. 



I'm sure that's how most people feel, but that doesn't help me.
