Some people are apparently afraid of people who live on Sun Hill,” says Evin.



“Who are they?



Strange people.”



I don't tell Evin that Petra is one of them.



The apartment has three rooms. Evin shares one of them with his little brother. 



Both his father and mother work at the factory. His mother is at home today and wants to offer him sweet tea. 



I get to look at their two rabbits. 



One is called Ruff and is Evin's rabbit, the other is her brother's. 



Evin says she has started to forget about Ruff lately. 



Sometimes she feels so guilty about it that she gets up in the middle of the night and hugs him hysterically.



'I hope he doesn't notice that I'm tired,' she says.



'I don't think he will,' I say. “He doesn't know that you can be hugged all the time.”



“He does, because in the beginning I was with him all the time.



But there has to be some variety, otherwise you don't appreciate when you get love.”



Evin looks at me like it's the smartest thing she's ever heard. “Thank you.”



Evin's mom is Leyla. 



She asks me why I moved to Bokarp and I tell her about my mother and her illness. 



Leyla listens without interrupting, then describes what it was like when she and Evin's father landed in the community.
