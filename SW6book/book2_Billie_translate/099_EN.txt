“God can help us in difficult times,” says Petra. 



He can help us bear what is heavy, if we only dare to open ourselves to him.



Many's breathing becomes heavier. I hear a whimpering sound. 



For a second I think he's got some kind of disease. What if Mange were to die and we were just sitting here? 



I try to look at him properly without staring too much. 



The next second I see a tear running down his cheek. 



It disappears down and hides in his clothes.



When the mass is over, he is back to his usual self. 



On the way out, he pinches my side and jokes that I'll be hanging out in church day and night from now on, “Right, Billie?”



The only thing I can think of is why he was crying.



In the back, a lone person remains in the pew: the lady with the polka-dotted tights. 



Her mouth is moving, as if she were talking to the angels on the ceiling.



Who is she?” I whisper in Alvar's ear.



The Finnish girl,' he says.



The Finnish girl?”



We walk through the heavy gate out into the sun. “You shouldn't bother with her.”



Why not?” I ask.



Because ... she's weird.”



I'm glad we have to wait for Petra outside the church. I want to see when the Finnish girl comes out.
