Did you clean up before I came?“



Petra pointed at her necklace. ‘No...’



”Maybe a little?“ I said hopefully.



”Mommy always cleans,” Tea said.



Monica's hand suddenly reached over and rubbed my hair for no reason.



Upstairs were Alva and Tea's rooms, and one that was supposed to be mine.



The walls in that room were also white. They had made a bed with blue and white striped sheets.



There was a yellow vase on the desk. It was so cold, I just wanted to go outside.



“Cecilia says you'll be very comfortable here,” she said.



I nodded because I could tell Petra was nervous. I felt sorry for her.



She shouldn't worry that I don't like her house.



Now she opens the wardrobe door and shows me where I can hang my clothes.



A few abandoned hangers hang despondently inside.



It's sad to look inside.



I've never hung anything on a hanger in my life.



I suddenly want to crawl into a drawer and hide.



This house is so big



and my room is so big 



that I don't know what to do with all those square meters.



At home, I only have my own corner, which is my bed.



I've never had a desk.



There's a strange atmosphere in the Persson household.



It's as if everyone in the family is starring in a TV show.
