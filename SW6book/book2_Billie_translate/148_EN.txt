The next day, Evin, Filippa and Mickis gather around me. 



They want to know what Nadine said in the tunnel after school. 



Tell me!” I run over to Alvar. 



Lately he has started to stretch more. 



He says several sentences at once. I hope I'm not just imagining things. 



Maybe next week you'll be able to talk for a whole minute straight,” I say. 



Alvar looks unconvinced.



Evin comes running over. I'm so cold I shiver in my thin jacket.



“What did Nadine say?



We'll talk later.”



She would never have contacted you if we hadn't told her you would talk to her.”



Later,” I say. “After school.”



In class, I think about me and Evin. 



Every time we look at each other, I want to laugh with her,



ride my bike to ping-pong, sit in her kitchen and talk to her mom. 



That's how it is. 



Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if Evin and the other girls found out Nadine's secret 



after all, it's not her who has done anything, but her father. 



Poor Nadine, I think in the next second. 



Poor Nadine who might be betrayed by the only person she chose to tell everything to. 



I promised her to keep quiet. 



After all, what good is Elin's friendship when I'm always so afraid of her getting too close?
