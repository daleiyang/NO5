What are you doing here?” the girl asks in broken Swedish.



Petra introduces me and explains that I wanted to go to the kiosk. 



The couple take my hand and say welcome to Bokarp.



How is mom?” Petra asks.



'Better,' says the girl. “How lucky you are to help her see a doctor. Thank you so much.”



“What would we do without you?



Will she be allowed to stay?” Petra asks.



She'll know soon.” Petra puts a hand on the girl's arm. “You know you can call me if you want to talk.”



Lack?



I stand next to her and realize that I should be grateful that I have ended up with Bokarp's fine priest.



We walk through the courtyards surrounded by the tall houses. There are more people here than in the city. 



The adults have gone out to play with the children or just sit and talk. 



Some little boys are playing soccer a bit away. 



A few minutes later we arrive at the usual kiosk. Outside are some people with mopeds. 



They are a different type of young people than in Stockholm, but it's hard to put your finger on what the difference is,



maybe it's just the mopeds.



There you go,” says Petra. “Now we've been to the kiosk.”



I look down at an old, worn wooden bench where people have carved their names and other things like “cock”.



Surely that's what Petra dislikes about this place. 



When I turn to her, she's staring at the road in front of the kiosk. 



The next second she jerks and takes my hand. “Nah, we have to go now.”



I have to run alongside her to keep up. 



If I asked why she was so strange, I would never get an answer, you just know.
