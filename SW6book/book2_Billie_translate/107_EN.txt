But only for a brief second. 



The next moment we're screaming with laughter as we play dunk with some others in the yard. 



We hide together behind some digging buckets.



We laugh so hard that the laughter bubbles out and we are discovered. I love Sun Hill.



I keep my promise and try to talk to Nadine.



But first, Evin and Filippa lure Ayo over to their gang. 



Ayo is going to go home with Filippa after school for the first time. 



In a second, Nadine is all alone. 



I catch up with her on the way to the dining room and ask if we should sit together. She nods vaguely. 



I talk on as we take taco grilled chicken, 



telling her about Stockholm and when I was in the food group that demanded a new caterer, 



until I realized that groups weren't for me. 



Nadine doesn't seem very interested.



We end up alone at a table. Nadine looks down at her plate and eats. 



Her eyelashes are certainly longer than anyone else's. 



I ask questions that go unanswered and glance at Evin, who is sitting at the other end of the room making faces. 



I'm about to give up when Nadine puts her fork down on the plate.



Why are you in foster care?‚Äù



It doesn't sound like when the others are throwing out their questions. Nadine wants to know, for real.
