Her mouth moves only a little, her eyes are completely blank. 



A lady in the choir walks up to Petra and puts her arms around her. 



They stand and hug while the rest of us continue singing “Amazing Grace”. 



It's strange, but suddenly I feel as if I'm in the middle of a community even though I'm among complete strangers.



Petra was supposed to stay for a while, so I am joined from the choir by Filippa. 



She's still grumpy. The worst thing I know is grumpy people. We lead the bikes.



Filippa has one that costs five thousand, she says. It has gotten dark. 



Not a single person or car is visible. The fog is thick around the streetlights. 



There is something ghostly about Bokarp in the evening.



Are you going to continue in the choir?” Filippa asks. 



In the same second I realize that she wants me to answer no.



Of course.”



Filippa makes a face. “But then you might not have to sing so loud. 



Excuse me for saying so, but you don't even know the songs.”



I'm trying.”



Yes, but it's not so easy for others to sing correctly when you get the wrong melody in your ear.”



We continue in silence. 



I wonder what she will say to the class, how embarrassing I was.



I'm sure she'll whisper to Evin that I'm not normal. 



But I don't have the energy to deal with it. Not right now.
