We talk about coffee things, help each other count and remember to brew more coffee. 



After a while, I notice how both Evin and I start to relax. 



We say “thank you very much” to each person who hands over their money, and laugh for no reason. 



Evin mimics different people's dialects so well that I wonder why she doesn't go to a theater class instead of practicing ping-pong.



Filippa comes up and wants to buy a chocolate biscuit.



When she hands me the money, I sing out “heartfelt thanks” as if it were an opera. 



Evin laughs so hard that bubble crumbs spray out of her mouth. 



Filippa stares at us in horror. Evin laughs even harder. I get a lump in my stomach.



An hour later, the girls' class I signed up for starts. 



In the first two games, I play girls from other clubs, 



and lose 11-2, 11-2, 11-4 in the first match, and get blanked in one set in the second. 



Since there are so few entries for the girls' class, I get to play Filippa in the last match in the pool. 



She is not among the best girls, 



but she's been playing since she was seven so it's a given what will happen. 



She doesn't look at me when she enters the paddock with her racket in one hand and her water bottle in the other. 



I joke that I need to pee so “You'll have to crush me quickly”.



She balls in with stone face. Feeds ping pong balls at me like a robot. 



I can only take half of them.
