I crawl under the covers, put the computer on my stomach and connect to their wifi. 



Right now I'm following four different series. 



The one I love the most is a police series that is as much about crime as it is about the private lives of police officers. 



The best part is when things get tough with family or work. 



When they argue with each other about who's in charge and cry because a bad guy has murdered their colleague. 



I know all about infidelity: sometimes you just can't resist. 



You just have to have sex with someone, even though you have a husband or wife at home. 



Afterwards you can regret it a lot.



I feel at home with the characters in the TV series. 



I've been with them for several seasons. 



I know exactly who's going to do the right thing and who always gets it wrong. 



I know why the guy who always betrays his family does it. 



He's been abandoned by his parents when he was a kid, 



so it's no wonder he's afraid to trust other people. 



I always cheer him on. You can see how much he's struggling.



In the middle of a love scene, when they have taken off almost all their clothes, there is a knock on the door. 



Mange sticks his head in. He opens his eyes wide. 



How cozy you've made it in here. Clever with the curtain ... on the lamp.”



I smile and look into the computer again to make him realize that I want to be alone.



What are you doing?”



Just looking at something.”
