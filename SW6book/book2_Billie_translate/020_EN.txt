I long for the cameras to be turned off and for everyone to be themselves.



Alvar and Tea remain outside the room, like the ghost children in horror movies, serious, silent. 



Alvar still hasn't looked me in the eye. It makes me a little angry. 



You should be able to make an effort when a new member of the family arrives, shouldn't you? 



You should be able to say at least two words?



What grade are you in?” I ask, even though I already know.



Sixth grade. We'll be in the same class.”



Funny.”



Mm.” But he doesn't seem to think so.



Very funny,” says Petra, anyway. “Alvar and you can go to school together.”



Cecilia nods eagerly. “It's good to know someone when you start a new class, right? Right, Billie?”



I nod. But I don't really agree. 



It's better to come alone and not have to think about anyone else. 



Maybe I'll have to walk around with Alvar all day.



Petra and Tea whisper to each other. It turns out that Tea wants to show her room. 



She skips ahead with her tassel flapping and proudly opens the door with the sign “Do not disturb”. 



The walls are pink and the whole room is filled with pink things. 



There are fluffy pink pillows on the bed and pink curtains with glitter hanging along the windows.



Why do you like pink so much?” I ask.
