I hope you won't have to,” Petra replies. “Is Lennart okay?”



“Yes, but it's still the hip...”



I'll come in to see you one day. With rhubarb juice.”



The aunt lights up. Petra waves goodbye. 



She and Cecilia walk towards the door on either side of me, as if I need help getting there.



I can't believe this is where I'm going to live. In this boring place. 



I've seen similar areas before, of course, but not in real life. 



The small town where the train stopped seems like paradise. 



I grab Cecilia's hand and stand on tiptoe to reach her. 



“This is not possible,” I whisper. “It's really not possible.”



Inside the brown house, everything is painted white. 



It's so white that it feels like no one lives in the house, 



as if no one has played here or bumped into a wall even once.



There are dried flowers on the wall and a picture of a landscape in dull colors. 



There are neat rows of shoes on the floor and only four jackets hanging on the hooks.



“You can hang your jacket here,” says Mange, as if I didn't get it.



Petra calls the children and looks up at the stairs.



I realize that she is nervous about how it will be. 



Will her children like me? Will I like them?
