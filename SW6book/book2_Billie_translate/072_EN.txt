The whole school seems to have gathered in the hall. 



At least half the class is there. Alvar too. 



His training clothes are too small, which makes me a little sad.



Mange lights up when he sees me. “Oh what fun, Billie! How happy I am!”



People gather around the tables. I get to borrow Evins spare rack. 



Mange tells me that we are going to do forehand loops.



I don't know what forehand is, but he's happy to tell me. 



Forehand is what I've always done on the round robin, it turns out. 



Backhand I am worse at, but I get some tips. 



Mange shows me how to screw, but that's really where the limit is.



Evin disappears to play with an older girl.



It goes so fast when they drive that I barely have time to see the ball. 



My gaze wanders on to Alvar who stands and sort of pushes his ball over the net. 



His body is so stiff that I want to go over and shake him. 



Mange stops at Alvar's table to watch the game.



The smile disappears from his lips. He interrupts to show him how to do it. 



Alvar listens and tries. But it's the same again.



I've never given table tennis a second thought in my life,



but now I want nothing more than to be good at it.



I want to be able to hit the same shots as Evin and be one of the people playing in the big competition in a few weekends.



On the way home I ask Alvar and Mange what kind of music they like. Mange only likes hard rock. 



When he talks about his favorite bands, there's no stopping him. 



I'll never know what kind of music Alvar likes.
