Alvar looks at me with gratitude in his eyes. Then he giggles. “If mom and dad knew, they'd probably take me to a psychologist.”

The smile disappears from his lips. He has spotted something behind my back. I turn around.



Douglas and Salim are riding their bikes outside the kindergarten, making annoying noises. 



Alvar's face has become hard and closed.



Why do you hate Douglas?” I ask.



He's an idiot,” says Alvar.



Why is he an idiot?”



He keeps walking, being his usual buttoned-up self. Suddenly I get annoyed. 



He can talk on and on about his fantasy monsters but not about anything real.



Why can't you just tell it like it is?”



He glares at me under those bangs. “About what?”



How did Casper really die?”



A moped rumbles past and disappears behind the bend in front of us.
