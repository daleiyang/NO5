Poor, poor Alvar, who doesn't know that there are other things in life than this cold, tidy house and boring, boring Bokarp.



Have you been to Stockholm?” I ask.



He has sat down at his desk. “Nah. But in India.”



I am stunned. “India?”



Alvar takes a deep breath. “We took a long trip last year. With the family. I got time off from school too.”



How was it?”



He sits so still you'd never know he was there if you were blind. 



You were riding on a wagon behind someone on a bike.”



I nod, as if I understood. Although I've never been abroad.



What's fun about fishing?”



I think he's going to start showing me his rods and tell me everything he knows about pike and cod. 



But nothing happens at all. His face is so serious that I get a lump in my stomach.



I don't know if it's that funny.”



What do you think is funny then?”



Not much.”



He turns his back on me and turns on his game on the computer. 



His fingers move across the keyboard. I remain standing behind him.



But what are you doing out there? In the little house?”
