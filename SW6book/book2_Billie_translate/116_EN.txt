I cycle like a fool out of Bokarp. The forest and the fields spread out more and more. 



The wind in my face and in my hair. Freedom. From the wide road I take a narrow one. 



I had realized that Nadine lives in the country.



But I had no idea how many trees there were in the world, or how many insects want to look into my nose. 



I check the GPS on my phone that I'm on the right track. Five minutes later I arrive.



The small house is all alone by a winding stream. In front of it is an old car. 



A dog is running around by itself and barking: the golden retriever. 



I throw my bike into the woods and sneak closer to the house, slipping in behind a shed. 



The front door is half open. The laundry hangs on a line. 



The sheets flutter in the wind.



A woman with brown hair as long as Nadine's comes out. 



She puts her hand in her pocket and takes out a pack of cigarettes, sinks down on the stairs and lights a cigarette. 



She takes long, deep puffs. 



There's something about the way she smokes that makes me think of my mother.



The door is thrown open again. Nadine comes out onto the stairs. 



She looks anxiously towards the road I just came cycling on. 



Aren't you coming in?‚Äù She who I think is the mother does not answer. It is quiet for a while. 



The wind is shaking the trees around me, making my hair stand on end. 



I back into the corner.
