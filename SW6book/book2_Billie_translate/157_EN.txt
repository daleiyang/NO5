IT'S THE DAY of the big ping pong competition and even though I haven't played ping pong for a long time, I've signed up for two different classes. 



The competition is the biggest thing that happens in Bokarp. 



No one has any expectations of me. 



Not even I myself will be sad if I lose.



If I won a single set, it would actually be a sensation. 



I think standing in the cafeteria will be at least as much fun as playing. 



I will work there as much as possible when the other classes are played.



After the game night, we haven't talked much about Casper. 



But I don't know how it sounds when I'm not there. 



Anyway, the next day Petra hung a photo of him on the wall, 



and the day after that, there was a framed drawing on the shelf. 



I didn't say anything, although I did wonder why none of it had been there before.



Alvar didn't want to enter the competition at first, but then Mange was disappointed.
