The bag is not exactly dirty, nor am I, 



but he brushes so carefully, you wonder what he thinks of me. 



Maybe he has cleanliness mania, because he was scolded when he was a kid for yawning, 



in which case I feel really sorry for him. 



But there's a better chance it's my hair that's bothering him. 



I get to my feet. The train rolls in. People give each other last hugs. 



I feel a little sad because I realize that they will miss each other. 



I've seen how people long in the TV series. 



I know it can hurt so much that it brings tears. 



I know that you can lie awake at night. 



Maybe I will feel that way too, in Bokarp. But I don't think so.



A young guy lifts my suitcase as easily as possible when I am about to go on. 



Before I can thank him, he has disappeared. 



The train picks up speed and I try to find my seat. 



The bag is clumsy to pull in the narrow aisles and more than one looks annoyed. 



Finally, I ask the conductor where I should sit and it turns out I'm in the wrong carriage. 



After an eternity I find the right one.



The first person I see when I enter the carriage is Cecilia. 



She's standing with her cell phone to her ear and talking in a shrill voice. 



She spots me and widens her eyes. “Billie! There you are!”



I push the bag in where it should be. 



Cecilia rushes forward and hugs me tightly. 



Her heart beats against my ear.
