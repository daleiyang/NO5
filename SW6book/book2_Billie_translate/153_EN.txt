The problem is that it can never be the slightest bit cozy when they insist on not raising the heat. 



I have to get an extra sweater to keep me warm.



It happens to be going very well for Mange. And Tea walks his streets all the time.



Fucking bullshit,” says Tea.



She gets a stern look from Petra, 



because even though the children can decide for themselves whether they want to believe in God or not, they absolutely cannot swear.



“Monopoly is just luck,” complains Tea.



Mange doesn't agree with that. 



He says it's about daring to play out and encourages Alvar to take risks. 



But it doesn't help. 



Alvar buys almost no streets and sits and holds on to the money as long as he can. 



After a couple of hours, Mange has a whole empire of red hotels on the board. 



Alvar steps on one of them and is out. 



Tea bets on building in the wrong position and goes out too. 



Petra runs off to fetch “something good” as consolation. It's the fruit. 



And a cloth with which she persistently rubs the table.



Alvar and Tea are sitting on the sofa, moping. I put my long dreadlocks over Tea's head. 



You can play instead of me! You can pretend to be me.” 



But she shakes off her hair and mumbles something I can't hear.



I can tell that Petra is getting annoyed with Mange.
