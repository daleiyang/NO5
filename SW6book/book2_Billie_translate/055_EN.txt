A few people come out of the store with grocery bags, otherwise it is almost empty here too. 



I had hoped for a crowd. An eerie feeling creeps in.



There's the big store, and there's the pizzeria, and there's actually a clothing store with both children's and adult clothes.” 



Petra walks eagerly towards a low building. 



And here we have the library! They renovated it last year, so it's very cozy.”



We go in, and there's nothing wrong at all. 



But it's still just shelves of books and a lonely lady behind the lending desk. 



A mother sits with her small child on her lap, reading in a corner. 



The atmosphere is so depressing that I have to get out, otherwise there's a risk that I'll get really depressed.



Shall we borrow some books?” Petra asks.



I have the computer.”



Petra gets a wrinkle between her eyes. “But that's something completely different.”



“Mom only likes TV too,” I say. “We watch series together. 



We can lie in bed all weekend and barely get out of bed.”



Petra studies me seriously.



We can go here and borrow another day,” I continue. “When I've digested all the impressions.”



She doesn't argue. A few seconds later we are back out in the square.
