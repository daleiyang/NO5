Why does she think she's something just because of that?” I whisper back.



Because... .”, Evin looks at me in wonder. “London!”



I pretend to get the hint. “Of course.”



My father is from Kurdistan, but that doesn't really count.” 



She imitates a man gesticulating wildly and speaking in broken Swedish. 



Evin. What is this ping pong? Hitting a small, silly ball? What?”



At recess, Evin grabs my arm before Alvar has even gotten up from his chair. At first I don't understand what she's doing. 



I'm not the kind of person who walks arm in arm with friends, but Evin can't know that. 



She can't know that I've never had a best friend in my life and I'm with a different one every day. 



We get an entourage of curious girls following us when we go out in the schoolyard. 



Evin tells us about the crazy aunt she met on her way to school. 



The aunt walks around Bokarp and talks loudly to herself.



Evin imitates her voice. Everyone laughs. 



I want to say that I also talk to myself sometimes because it helps me think. 



But I'm not sure they would laugh then.



Everyone stops at the benches as if on cue, sits down in a jumble and gets their cell phones out.



Are you really from Stockholm?” asks a girl called Mickis.
