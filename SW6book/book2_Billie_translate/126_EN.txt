You don't know how strange people are, how strange the Persson family is.



I tell my mom on skype. She starts crying as soon as I say “death”, then she can't stop. 



She cries and cries and says that everything is meaningless, her whole life is meaningless. 



Mom is in a depression, it shows. She is no help at all in situations like this. 



So the question is just as strong in me after we say goodbye: who will help the Persson family? 



I wander out into the woods behind the house and sing. At least it helps me.
