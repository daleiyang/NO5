THE ONLY THING I CAN think about is that Casper is dead. 



I fantasize about all the laughter that was in the house before and how it was when he just disappeared. 



It became quiet. It became sad. 



Mange and Petra started talking about being on time for dinner and eating right, all the time.



Even though I never knew Casper, I can't ignore him. 



It's almost as if he were my brother.



I watch Petra with new eyes as she puts up a shelf she bought in town. 



She's in her own world, where she feels most comfortable. 



I stand a little way away as she talks confidentially to a neighbor about how she feels about her husband. 



I hear that she likes to talk about her neighbor's problems to avoid her own. 



“You're the only one who listens,” says the neighbor. “How would I manage without you?” Petra and the neighbor hug. 



Petra says her neighbor can get out of her bad relationship, it's just a matter of taking what she feels seriously.
