Nothing.”



But you go there almost every day?”



He looks like he's itching all over. “I just like to be left alone.”



Me too.



He looks at me stupidly. “You like to be left alone?”



Yes, but I've decided to try to make friends.”



Alvar looks down at the ground. I regret it hysterically.



Maybe Alvar has also tried to make friends, but it hasn't worked. 



In any case, it is now too late to go back.



That afternoon, as I sit doing my homework, I hear the front door slam. 



I hurry to the window and see him walking towards the cottage. After a while I sneak after him. 



I step over the yellowing grass and crawl close to the wall by the window. 



I take a quick breath, then stick my head out and peek in. At first I think it's someone else. 



He looks so different from usual, with a lot of life in his eyes. 



His hands are moving down there, but I can't figure out what he's doing.



At dinner, Mange is nagging him to come to training. 



Alvar blames it on the fact that he still has a sore shoulder. 



Petra gets up and gets the dishcloth. She wipes up some sauce that Tea spilled next to her plate. 



Tea lifts her glass so that Petra can reach it. 



I feel like shouting something, but a song comes out instead, “Scream” by Michael Jackson. 



Everyone's eyes turn to me. I keep singing. 



Petra raises her voice, and I hear her say that we don't sing at the dinner table, but I can't stop.
