A mumble from Tea.



What?” I say.



Winnie the Pooh,” she squeaks.



And Moomin,” says Alvar.



A hasty smile on Petra's pale lips. “We were going to tell you about Casper, of course. 



But we wanted to wait until you felt at home.”



It's okay,” I say.



There's silence again. 



I'm surprised that Petra doesn't go to get something, that Mange doesn't start joking.



He liked singing so much too,” Petra says in a firmer voice. 



Casper loved to sing. Just like you, Billie.”



What did he sing?”



You know the one about the forest and the house,” says Tea.



About Santa looking out?”



Exactly,” says Petra. “He loved to do the movements. The hare skipping along.”



Mange comes to life. “When Casper danced, I couldn't sit still by myself.”



I always danced with him,” says Alvar.



All four of them smile at the same time, as if they just saw exactly that in front of them: Casper and Alvar dancing.



“I think I would have liked Casper,” I say.



The whole Persson family nods at the same time.
