THERE ARE SO MANY people on the platform that it's easy to get lost, luckily. 



I sit down on the bag to be sure. Down here, I'm practically invisible. 



People are looking into each other's eyes or into the void. 



I roll back and forth, back and forth on the wheels of the bag. 



I lift my feet and go down a small slope in the asphalt. 



Too late I realize that the train platform is about to end. 



Shit, I think, soon I will be lying on the tracks in pain and Cecilia will appear and say so it goes. 



But just before that happens I run into a pair of legs. 



The impact is so hard that both the bag and I fall to the ground.



“Sorry,” I say.



The man brushes off his pants with a sour face. 



Laughter bubbles up in me.
