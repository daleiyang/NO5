I GO TO SCHOOL as usual even though Casper is dead. 



But I can't listen very well in class. 



Maybe it shows, because Roya asks me to stay after school again.



Alvar has to wait outside so that we can have company home.



The sun is shining through the windows, which are even dustier than last time. 



Roya is wearing a funny, patterned sweater and long feather earrings. 



She asks me what I'm thinking about. 



Just because she is so pretty, I wish I could cry. 



But crying has never worked for me. 



Even when the social services told me I had to leave my mom, I didn't cry. 



Besides, it's risky to bring up the grief for Casper. 



Maybe Roya will contact Alvar and suggest he goes to the school psychologist. 



It would feel like I betrayed him. 



So I tell Roya that I'm not thinking about anything in particular.
