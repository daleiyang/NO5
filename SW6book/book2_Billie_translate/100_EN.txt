I mumble a song in the meantime. Mange is shushing. Alvar and Tea look embarrassed in another direction. 



It becomes clear how much there is in their lives that I still don't understand.



When Petra appears, I don't say that her voice was boring but that there was a nice message in her sermon. 



She hugs me and whispers, “Thank you, little Billie.” I take the opportunity to ask why we should beware of Finnish. 



Petra gets a look of uncertainty in her eyes. “Because...” Then it stops.



Is she dangerous?”



Petra shakes her head. I remember her fear of Sun Hill. 



Could it be that Petra preaches that everyone is equal before God, 



but she's as afraid as everyone else of those who are different? 



That would not be very funny.



I pretend to have left my cell phone on the bench and hurry back inside. 



The organ music is still playing, but only one person is left. 



Carefully, I sit down at the end of the same bench as her. 



She does not notice me but continues to talk to the ceiling. 



I slowly move closer. Finally, my legs are only a few meters away from the polka-dotted tights. 




There's a big rip in them.



Hey.”



She pretends not to notice me.



We met at the parish hall. I asked what you found in the trash.”
