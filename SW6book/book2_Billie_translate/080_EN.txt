Is she as pretty as she thinks?” Filippa asks.



I don't think so.”



Evin puts her feet on the ground and stops rocking.



Her mouth widens in a smile. “Maybe Billie can pretend to want to be friends with her!”



Me?



Yes, you can go home with her and spy!”



I don't get it. “But... why would I be allowed to go there?”



Because you're new too. And because you're a foster child.



Maybe she feels sorry for you.”



Filippa and Mickis nod.



“I don't know.”



I'm about to say that we should leave her alone. 



If Nadine doesn't want to spend time with us, that's just the way it is, everyone has to be as they want to be.



You can at least try! Please!”



Evin looks at me with her beautiful brown eyes. 



In the next second she jumps off the swing, sticks out her tongue and gets on all fours. 



Please, Billie.” She yelps like a dog and looks at me pleadingly. 



It's clear that Filippa doesn't think it's funny at all that Evin is going to such lengths to get my help.



I can't help but laugh, squat down and pat her on the head and say good dog. 



If I'm not smooth, I may not be able to walk her home anymore. 



Then I have to be at home in the sad house all the time, I just can't stand it.
