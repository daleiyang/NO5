Ugh.”



I sigh. “Everyone has a special seat at the table.



They have two computer-free days a week. 



Even Mange and Petra can't take out their laptops. It's so weird!”



Really.”



And listen! You're not allowed to drink water out of a glass here, you have to take your coat, which is hanging on the wall!”



Mom bursts out laughing. She laughs so loudly that I have to turn down the sound on the computer. 



Then I hear something behind me and turn around. 



Petra is standing in the doorway. She's staring at the screen with her mother's giant face on it.



A box ...? Oh my God, I'm dying... What fools there are!”



I try to signal to mom that she needs to stop. “It's not funny!”



But she doesn't notice, she's too busy laughing her ass off. 



Her big breasts bounce up and down. “Oh, oh, oh, Billie, oh, oh, oh.”



Petra closes gently. Mom comes closer to the screen with her face.



Poor Billie. What are we going to do about this?”



You're going to get better so I can come home,” I whisper with a lump in my throat. 



Cecilia said it was “temporary.”



You'll get better too, don't forget. Don't run your own race. Try to fit in.”
