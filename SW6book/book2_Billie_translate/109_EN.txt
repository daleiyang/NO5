Was it hard for you to be new?” I ask.



She shakes her head.



“Where did you live before?



In many places,” she says.



Why have you moved so much?”



She shrugs her narrow shoulders. “My mom can't stay in one place that long. 



Why can't she?”



She's just like that,” says Nadine.



But it's no fun for you, is it?”



She sweeps her eyes across the dining room. “She doesn't like people.”



And your father?” I ask.



Lives in London.”



Nadine looks down at the chicken, she doesn't seem to want to brag about him at all.



What are you doing after school?” I ask.



“Walking the dog.”



Can I come with you?”



Nadine stands up. “I can't.”



Why?”



Because ... you don't even live nearby.”



I have a bike.”



You can't ride your bike that far,” Nadine says, taking her plate.



'It doesn't matter,' I say, and follow her to the counter. 



Her shiny mane of hair lies like a cape on her back.
