TEA WILL BE my friend one hundred percent because I've been telling people in my old class about her makeup videos. 



Twenty-five people have clicked on them so far. 



She talks incessantly about the powerful feeling that comes when people look at you, 



she can't know that people have clicked on her videos as a favor to me. 



My friends think Miss Pinky is so bizarre that she's funny. 



The funny thing, according to them, is that she has no sense of humor and delivers her tips with such deadpan. 



She looks completely depressed when she talks about rouge,” writes Fanny on the chat. 



I will be addicted to her makeup videos!” I understand what they mean, but I can't laugh at Tea. 



Not when I know what she's been through.



We sit in her room and talk. 



I want to ask her about Casper, of course, but Tea is full of her own.
