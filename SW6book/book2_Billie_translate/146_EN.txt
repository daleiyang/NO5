I should adapt to your culture?”



Petra looks at Mange for help. 



But he continues with his salad without looking up.



You can't have different rules for different people in a home, Billie.”



Of course you can. If the people are different, with different backgrounds and different opinions.”



Alvar sets the table with ever faster movements.



You can tell he's uncomfortable with the fact that we're having a conflict, 



that he would rather run out to the cottage and build his army.



I calmly put a glass down on the shiny table top and turn to Petra. 



This is how it is. I don't like rules. I don't like order. 



I don't like everyone having to do the same things.”



Mange finishes her salad and looks at me in horror. 



Petra looks like she might faint at any moment.



No, but ...” That's where it stops. She doesn't want to run me over. 



She wants me to make my voice heard. 



At the same time: not everyone can do what they want.



Besides, I'm not hungry. I might be hungry in two hours, not now.”



I go to my room and throw myself on the bed. 



All too soon there is a knock on the door. 



It's Mange saying it's food. I reply that, as I said, I'm not hungry. 



He suggests that I come down and sit down anyway. To keep the others company.
