A neighborhood of houses with many more floors than two towers up a bit away. 



I am filled with gratitude that not everything is exactly the same in Bokarp.



Is that Solkullen?”



Petra nods. “And you shouldn't go there alone.”



“Why not?



They've had problems there.”



Finally, I hear something funny. “With?”



Petra screws up her face. “It's just been a bit messy.”



What do you mean, messy?”

Strict again. Both her voice and her body reveal how little she wants to continue talking about Sun Hill.



“What luck”, I say to lighten the mood, ”that it's not as quiet everywhere. You almost get worried.”



The closer we get to the area, the slower Petra walks. The color on her cheeks has disappeared. 



Or is it just her imagination? On the way we meet a dark-skinned couple walking towards us with a pram.



Petra!”



The girl comes running and dives into Petra's arms, then it's the boy's turn. Petra seems happy to see them.
