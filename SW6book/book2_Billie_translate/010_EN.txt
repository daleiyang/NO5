You can see in her eyes that she is the one who is afraid, 



afraid that everything will go wrong, that the family is not as nice as she thinks, 



or that I'll suddenly stop being so happy and sunny.



A little girl, maybe five years old, sits a few rows ahead with her face covered in tears. 



She reaches for her mother across the aisle. 



“I want to sit with you!” Her mother hisses, her face flushed. 



I get up and walk over to them.



“We have two seats next to each other. You can take them if you want.”



The mother looks at me in amazement. “But ... not ...?”



“We can sit spread out. It's fine.”



Cecilia looks at the girl with a pitying look, has nothing to object to.



In my new seat, I can be myself again. 



I pretend I'm traveling on my own, leaning back comfortably in the seat. 



Mom and I text each other. 



I write that everything is okay and she writes that she is thinking of me. 



Then I think about what it will be like when I arrive, about that mom and that dad. 



I wonder if they watch the same TV series as me.



Me and the old man sitting next to me start talking.



He's going to visit his son who's had his third child. 



I help him make some settings on his phone and install an app that tells you which bird is singing if you point your phone
at it.
