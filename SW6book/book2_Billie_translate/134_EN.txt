My classmates thought I was strange for not wanting to belong to anyone, 



who wanted to do different things, with different people. 



Sometimes I wanted to be with the guys, 



not because I loved soccer, but because I liked some of them and wanted to show people that I was a free person.



In the end it went well. I made friends, many different ones.



But maybe that's an impossibility in Bokarp.



Alvar and I walk home. We've started talking more lately. 



When he gets going, things happen in his face. 



He becomes a different person, a person with personality. 



I want to ask more about Casper, but Alvar tells me about something he read online about snakes. 



He has become so hooked on snakes that the army in the cottage has been expanded with a lot of murderous reptiles with magical powers. 



One can spit poisonous acid and the other can send laser darts with its eyes that kill in half a second.



You, who can't even see the forbidden children, how did you come up with all this?”



I've seen the forbidden child.” He swallows and glances behind him. 



“I downloaded a bunch of movies on my computer.



What?”



Don't tell me!”



I think of Mange and his secret horror collection. “I promise.”
