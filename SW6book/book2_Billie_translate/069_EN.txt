I can't help thinking that they must have been very bored before I arrived. 



Evin has decided that I am 'cool'. 



And if Evin thinks I'm cool, so does everyone else. 



As soon as I arrive at school, they wave me into the group where they talk to each other in low voices so that no one around can hear. 



They whisper about what people have said or done, or what some have written on their cell phones.



So many people want me to come home after school that we have to make a schedule. 



Evin is first. We walk away arm in arm at the end of the day. 



I pretend not to notice that Filippa is glaring. 



Evin looks so happy when she looks at me that I feel like singing. 



It's a Michael Jackson song that she knows the chorus to, “Man in the mirror”. 



I tell her that it's about how if you want to change the world, you have to start with yourself. 



Evin nods eagerly, as if she agrees with every word. 



We sing “Man in the mirror” all the way home to Evin. 



And as we sing, I realize that I'm starting to like Bokarp.



Evin lives in an apartment on Solkullen. 



She behaves as if it was the most natural thing in the world to live there. 



I knew it wouldn't be as dangerous as Petra said. 



The playground in the courtyard is like any other playground, the people are all kinds of people. 



I feel at home even though this is only my second time here.
