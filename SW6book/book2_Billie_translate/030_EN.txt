Cecilia cares about me, even though we're not close. 



It's actually quite nice. 



When I go to hug her, my eyes sting a bit like when tears are about to fall. 



It's not because I'm sad, but because I don't like to say goodbye. 



I cry at all movies when people are about to part, even if it's not the main characters.
