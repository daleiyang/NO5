That was Bokarp,” says Petra.



Is there nothing else?”



Well ... there's a gas station and a factory where they make toilet paper and sanitary towels and stuff. 



And then there's the church, but it's by the lake and that's a bit. And then there is ... .”, 



she sighs deeply, “a kiosk, up on Solkullen.”



“I want to go there.



There's nothing to see.”



She sounds so determined in her voice that I get curious.



But I have to find my way when I go to buy Saturday candy.”



Petra can't know that I've only heard of Saturday candy. 



In my own life it has never existed.



My mom has never cared how much sugar I've had, because she eats so much herself.



“There's candy at the store.



I want to go there anyway.”



I definitely smell something interesting.



You said you would show me Bokarp.”



Yes，yes.”



I follow her onto a footpath that winds away between some trees. 



Every now and then I look at Petra. Her face becomes more and more austere. 



It's as if she's lost in thought, as if she's forgotten I'm there. 



But then she suddenly remembers, and smiles with effort.
