Just because they cook properly and go on outings at the weekends doesn't mean they're that much healthier than mom. 



Mom has always told me everything,



laughing when she was happy and crying when she was sad. 



Okay, mostly she cried. 



But it would have been a thousand times worse if I hadn't known how she felt.



Evin and the others won't stop nagging about Nadine.



Filippa has the most nagging voice of all. 



During the lesson, I notice that she sits and studies me.



Maybe she's afraid that I'll tell Evin that she talked shit. 



She's probably waiting for the right moment to turn people against me.



I haven't been able to care much about Nadine,



but now that we're on our way to the gym, she comes up to me. 



She strokes her shiny hair and takes a deep breath. 



I secretly admire her long eyelashes. 



For a second I wonder if it would be possible to fall in love with her.



She leans forward and whispers in my ear. “I need to talk to you.”



Now?”



She shakes her head firmly. 



I look to the side and see Filippa and Evin watching us from a distance.
