Footsteps are heard from upstairs, the next second feet are seen on the stairs. 



A girl in pink tights and a high tassel comes skipping down. 



Behind her comes a boy with bangs hanging in his eyes. 



His whole body screams that he wants to leave. No wonder. 



What I've experienced so far in the house is not at all cozy. 



And it's cold. I don't exactly feel like taking my shoes off.



Mange introduces us and sounds as if everything is more fun than it is. 



Tea puts something in my hand.



Welcome.”



I look down at the pink cylinder. It says “Shiny lips” on it. 



A welcome gift? That's nice in that case. 



I thank her properly, even though I've never used lip gloss. 



Tea twinkles at me like a doll. 



Petra is just as unreal, with her overly large eyes and her transparent skin. 



Her thin blouse hangs as if on a hanger. 



Her hair lies in a perfect shape in the silver clasp at the nape of her neck.



They want to show the rooms on the ground floor first. 



There is the kitchen and the living room and another room where the mother and father sleep. 



The icy floor sends chills up my legs. 



Petra lights candles even though it is not yet dark. 



It continues to be white. There are no things anywhere. 



I wonder where they have put everything, 



if maybe there's a room where they've pushed the stuff in or if they've carried it out to the garage.
