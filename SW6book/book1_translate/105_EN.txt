“We have to remember this,” said Parvana.



“When things get better and we get bigger, we have to remember that one day 



when we were children, we stood in a cemetery 



and dug up bones to sell so our families could eat.”



“Will anyone believe us?”



“No, they won't. But we know it really happened.”



“When we are rich old ladies, we will drink tea together and talk about this day.”



The girls leaned against their board shovels and



watched the other children working. 



The sun went into clouds again and they also went back to work. 



They filled the blanket once more before finishing their work for the day.



“If we give all this money to our families, we'll never get any trays,” said Shauzia.



“I say we keep some and don't give it all away.”



“Are you going to tell your family what you did today?”



“No,” said Shauzia.



“Me neither,” said Parvana. 



“I'm just going to give them the same amount as I usually do or maybe a little more. 



I'll tell you later, but not right now.”



They parted after first agreeing to meet again early the next morning to dig for bones for another day.
