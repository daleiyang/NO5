The more they ignored her, the safer she felt.



When she had gone to the market with her father, 



she'd kept quiet and hidden her face as best she could. 



She had done her best to be invisible. 



Now, with her face bare in the sunshine, she was invisible in a different way. 



She was one of the boys in the street. 



She was not someone worth noticing.



When she arrived at the shop selling tea, rice and other foodstuffs, 



she hesitated for a moment but then walked boldly through the door. 



I am a boy, she repeated to herself. It gave her courage.



“What do you want?” the shopkeeper asked.



“Some ... some tea,” stammered Parvana.



“How much? What kind?” The shopkeeper was harsh,



but it was just the usual harshness of a bad temper, not the harshness of anger that there was a girl in the shop.



Parvana pointed to the tea they usually drank at home.



“Is that the cheapest?”



“This is the cheapest.”



He showed her another variety.



“I'll take the cheapest. I also need two and a half kilos of rice.”



“Don't say anything. You want the cheapest. Spender pants on, I see!”
