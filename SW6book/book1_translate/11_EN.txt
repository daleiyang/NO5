When the Taliban came, she wished most of all that she was invisible.



Now the client asked her father to read the letter again.



“Read it slowly, so I can remember it and tell my family.”



Parvana would have loved to receive a letter.



Mail delivery had recently resumed in Afghanistan, after years of being disrupted by the war.



Many of her friends had fled the country with their families. 



She thought they were in Pakistan, but she wasn't sure so she couldn't write to them. 



Her own family had moved so often because of the bombings that her friends no longer knew where she lived.



“Afghans are scattered across the earth like stars across the sky,” her father often said.



Her father finished reading the man's letter for the second time. The customer thanked him and paid.



“I'll look you up when it's time to write a reply.” !



Most people in Afghanistan could neither read nor write. 



Parvana was one of the lucky ones.



Both her parents had studied at university, and they believed that everyone has the right to education, including girls.



Customers came and went during the afternoon.
