At one point, all four children were sitting along the wall, looking at their mother where she was sleeping.



“She must get up soon,” said Nooria. “She can't lie there forever.”



Parvana was tired of sitting still. 



She had lived in that room for a year and a half, 



but there had always been things to do, and then the trips to the market with Dad.



Mom was still in the same place. 



They were careful not to disturb her. 



Still, Parvana thought that if she had to whisper and try to keep the younger children quiet for much longer, she would soon be shouting out loud.



It would have helped if she could have sat down and read, but the only books they had were Daddy's secret books. 



She dared not take them out of hiding. 



What would happen if the Taliban came barging in again? 



They would take the books, and maybe punish the whole family for keeping them.



Parvana noticed that Ali had changed.



“Is he sick?” she asked Nooria.



“He longs for his mother.”



Ali sat on Nooria's lap. 



He no longer crawled around when you put him on the floor. 



Most of the time he sat still, curled up like a ball, sucking his thumb. 



He didn't even cry anymore. 



It was nice to get a rest from the noise, but Parvana didn't like seeing him like this.
