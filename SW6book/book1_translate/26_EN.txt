Hossain had been the oldest child. 



He was killed by a landmine when he was fourteen. 



Mom and Dad never talked about him. 



It was too painful to think about him. 



Nooria had told Parvana about him on one of the rare occasions when they spoke to each other.



Hossain had laughed a lot and always tried to get Nooria to play with him, even though she was a girl. 



“Don't be such a princess,” he used to say. “A little football is just good for you!” Sometimes, Nooria said, 



she would give in and play with her son, and Hossain would always kick the ball to her so she could catch it and kick it back.



“He would often pick you up and play with you,” Nooria told Parvana. 



“He actually seemed to like you. Imagine that!”



From what Nooria told me, Hossain seemed to have been someone Parvana would have liked too.



Seeing the pain on her mother's face, Parvana stopped being angry and quietly helped.



preparing the evening meal.



The family ate in the Afghan way, wrapped around a wax cloth on the floor. 



The food cheered them all up, and they stayed seated for a while after the meal was over.



Parvana knew that soon a secret signal would be sent between her mother and Nooria and that they would both get up at exactly the same time and start setting the table.
