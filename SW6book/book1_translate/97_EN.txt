It was a beautiful white handkerchief with embroidered edges.



Parvana was about to look up at the window and smile in thanks when Shauzia plopped down on the blanket.



“What do you have there?”



Parvana jumped and put the handkerchief in her pocket.



“Uh, nothing. How have you been today?”



“As usual, but I have good news. 



Some of the tea boys heard about a way to make money. A lot of money.”



“How so?”



“You won't like it. 



Actually, neither do I, but you make better money than we do now.”



“What is it?”



Shauzia told her. Parvana's jaw dropped.



Shauzia had been right. She didn't like it.
