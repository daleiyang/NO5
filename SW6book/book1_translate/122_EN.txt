She didn't want to know more about death and blood and pain. 



The marketplace was no longer exciting. 



She no longer laughed when a man started arguing with his stubborn donkey. 



She was no longer interested in the random bits of conversation she heard from people walking by. 



Everywhere there were hungry and sick people. 



Women in burkas sat on the sidewalk begging with their babies stretched across their laps.



And it never ended.‚Äù This wasn't a summer vacation that would end and then return to normal. 



This was what was normal and Parvana was tired of it.



Summer had come to Kabul. 



Flowers were coming out of the ground and they didn't care about Taliban or landmines. 



They were even blooming, just like when there was peace. 



At Parvana's home, it got very hot during the long June days and the toddlers had trouble sleeping at night because of the heat. 



Even Maryam lost her good humor and whined like the youngest children. 



Parvana was happy that she could leave in the mornings.



Summer brought fruit to Kabul from the fertile valleys - those that had not been destroyed by bombs. 



Parvana brought goodies home to her family on days when she had earned a little more money. 



They ate peaches one week, plums the next.
