Parvana loved being at the market. 



She loved watching the people moving around in the streets, 



loved listening to the bits of conversation that reached her ears, 



loved reading the letters that people brought to her.



She still longed for Dad, 



but as the weeks went by, she began to get used to him being gone. 



It helped that she was so busy now. 



They didn't talk about him in the family, but she heard her mother and Nooria crying sometimes. 



Once Maryam had a nightmare that woke her up calling for her father. 



It took a long time for her mother to get her back to sleep.



Then, one afternoon, Parvana saw Dad in the market!



He was walking with his back to her, but Parvana was sure it was him.



“Daddy!” she cried, jumping up from the blanket and running after him. “Daddy, here I am!”



She ran straight into the crowd, 



pushing people out of the way until she finally caught up with Dad and threw herself around his neck.



“Dad, you're okay! They let you out of jail!”
