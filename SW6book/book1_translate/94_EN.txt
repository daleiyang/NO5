“This time you can go without eating,” said mom, 



“but now that you know where we live, you must bring your whole family and come and eat with us.”



“It's just my mom and me and my two little sisters left,” said Shauzia. 



“Mom never goes out. She is sick all the time. 



We live with my grandma and grandpa and one of my dad's sisters. 



Everyone fights all the time. I'm lucky that I can go away to work.” 



“Yes, you are welcome here anytime,” said mom. 



“Can you study at home?” Mrs. Weera asked.



“My grandmother and grandfather don't think girls need to have any education, 



and Mom says we have to do what they say because we live in their house.” 



“What do they say about you dressing like a boy and going out to work?” 



Shauzia shrugged. 



“They eat the food I buy. What can they say?”



“I have thought of starting a small school here.”



Mrs. Weera said, to Parvana's surprise. 



“A secret school for a few girls, a few hours a week. 



You have to be there. Parvana will tell you when we start.”



“But what about the Taliban?”
