They emptied the first grave, 



then moved to the next, taking Mr. Skull with them. 



Soon he was joined by another skull. 



By the time their blanket was full of bones, there were five skulls in a row grinning down at the girls.



“I have to pee,” said Parvana. “What should I do?”



“I need to pee too.” Shauzia looked around. 



“There's a doorway over there,” she said, pointing to a collapsed building nearby. 



“You can go first. I'll keep watch.”



“Guard me?”



“Our legs.”



“Should I pee in there?”



“No one can see you there. Either you do it, or you don't.” 



Parvana nodded and put down the shovel.



She had already been holding it for a long time.



She looked around to make sure no one was watching her and walked over to the protective doorway. 



“Hey, Kasim.” 



Paryvana turned to her friend. 



“Watch out for landmines,” Shauzia said.



Then she grinned. Paryvana grinned back. 



Shauzia was probably joking, but she kept her eyes open anyway.



“In Kabul there are more landmines than flowers.”
