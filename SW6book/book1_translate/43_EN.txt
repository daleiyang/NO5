It was very late when Parvana and her mother came home from prison. 



Parvana was so tired that she had to lean on her mother to get up the stairs, just as her father used to lean on her. 



She had stopped thinking about everything except the pain that throbbed in every part of her body, from her head to the soles of her feet.



Her feet burned and ached with every step she took. 



When she took off her sandals, she realized why. 



Her feet were covered in blisters. 



She was not used to walking such long distances. 



Most of the blisters had burst, and her feet were all bloody and the skin was scraped off.



Nooria and Maryam's eyes widened when they saw Parvana's feet. 



Their eyes got even bigger when they saw the state of their mother's feet. 



They were worse off than Parvana's.



Parvana realized that their mother hadn't been out of the house since the Taliban had seized power in Kabul a year and a half earlier.
