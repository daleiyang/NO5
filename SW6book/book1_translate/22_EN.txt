Good mood or bad, the water had to be fetched and she had to do it.



Finally the water tank was filled, the bucket was full and Parvana had to take off her sandals, hang up her chador and rest. 



She sat down on the floor next to Maryam and watched her little sister draw.



“You are really good, Maryam. 



One day you will be able to sell your drawings for tons of money. 



Then we'll be very rich and we'll live in a castle and you'll wear dresses made of blue silk.” 



“Green silk,” said Maryam.



“Green silk,” agreed Parvana.



Instead of just sitting there, you can come here and help us.”



Mom and Nooria cleaned out the cupboard again.



“But you cleaned the cupboard only three days ago!” 



“Are you going to help us or not?”

“The Taliban have said we have to stay indoors, but that doesn't mean we have to live in a pigsty,” Mom used to say.



Parvana hated all that cleaning.
