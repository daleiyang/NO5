But the woman still did not let her go.



Parvana did not know what to do. 



She couldn't stay in the house all night, 



but this frightened woman obviously didn't want to be left alone.



She searched for the tray in the dark and found two small bags of dried fruit and nuts.



“Take this,” she said, handing one to the woman. 



“You think better after you eat.”



The woman swallowed the fruit and nuts in one bite.



“You must be starving,” Parvana said, handing her another bag.



Parvana chewed and thought and finally decided what to do.



“This is the best idea I can think of,” she said. 



“If you can think of something better, tell me. Otherwise, this is what we'll do. 



We'll wait here until it's pitch black outside. 



Then we'll join you at my place. Do you have a chador?”



The woman shook her head. 



Parvana wished she had brought her pakul, 



but it was summer and she had left it at home.



“Do we have a deal?” Parvana asked.



The woman nodded.
