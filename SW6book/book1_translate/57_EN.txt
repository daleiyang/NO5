“Get the bucket, little girl. Make a contribution to the team. That's it, let's go!” 



Mrs. Weera still sounded like she was out on the field hockey pitch, encouraging everyone to do their best.



“Where's Fatana?” she asked as Parvana went to fetch the water bucket.



Nooria pointed to the figure buried under a blanket on the toshak. 



Mom groaned and tried to curl up even more.



“She's sleeping,” Nooria said.



“How long has this been going on?”



“Four days.”



“Where is your father?”



“Arrested.”



“Oh, I see.” She saw Parvana standing there, holding the empty bucket. 



“Are you waiting for it to start raining inside so that the bucket fills itself? Now get going!”



Parvana walked away.



She walked back and forth seven times. 



Mrs. Weera met her at the top of the stairs outside the apartment the first two times and took the filled buckets from her, 



emptied them inside and came back out with an empty bucket.



“We're cleaning up your mom, and she doesn't need any more eyes looking at her right now.”



After that, Parvana carried the water into the water tank as usual. 



Mrs. Weera had gotten Mom up and made sure she washed herself.
