The woman said nothing. Parvana glanced out the door. 



It was getting late. 



If she was going to make it home before curfew, she had to leave now.



“Come with me,” Parvana said. 



“Mom isn't home, but Mrs. Weera is there. She can solve any problem.”



She lit another match and held it up in front of the woman. 



Suddenly she realized that she could see the woman's face. 



It was not covered.



“Where is your burqa?” She looked around but found none. 



“Have you gone out without your burka?”



The woman nodded.



“What are you doing outside without a burka? You could get in real trouble.”



The woman just shook her head.



Parvana had an idea.



“Here's what we'll do. I'll go home and borrow Mrs. Weera's burka and bring it back here. 



Then we'll go back to my place together. That will be good, right?”



Parvana was about to get up, but the woman held her arm.



Once again, Parvana looked out at the darkening sky.



“I need to tell Mrs. Weera where I am. 



She doesn't mind me being out during the day, 



but if I don't come home by night, she'll worry.”
