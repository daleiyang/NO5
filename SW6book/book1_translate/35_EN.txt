Every sound made Parvana hopeful and scared at the same time.



She missed her father's snoring. He used to snore softly and pleasantly. 



During the many bombings of Kabul, they moved many times to try to find a safe place. 



Parvana used to wake up in the middle of the night and not know where she was. 



As soon as she heard her father's snoring, she knew she was safe.



Tonight there were no snores.



Where was Daddy? Did he have something soft to lie on when he slept? 



Was he cold? Was he hungry? Was he scared?



Parvana had never been inside a prison, but several of her relatives had been arrested. 



One of her aunts had been arrested along with hundreds of other schoolgirls for protesting against the Soviet occupation of the country.



All Afghan governments used to send their enemies to prison.



“You're not a real Afghan if you don't know anyone who's been in prison,” her mother would sometimes say.



But no one had told her what it was like in prison. 



“You're too young to know that,” the adults would say. She had to imagine it herself.



It must have been cold, Parvana thought, and dark.
