“I went to get water yesterday!”



“I had to clean and do laundry. Ali was almost out of diapers. 



Would you rather wash diapers than fetch water?”



Parvana fetched the water.



“Keep those clothes on,” Nooria said when Parvana came back. 



“I've thought this through. 



If you're going to be a boy outside, you should be a boy inside too. 



What would happen if someone came to visit you?”



Parvana understood that.



“But what about mom? Won't she be sad to see me in Hossain's clothes all the time?”



“She'll have to get used to it.”



For the first time, Parvana noticed the tired lines on Nooria's face. 



She looked much older than her seventeen years.



“I can help you with the evening meal,” she offered.



“You? Help out? All you can do is run in my way.”



Parvana was furious. It was impossible to be nice to Nooria!



Mom got up for the evening meal and made an effort to be in a good mood. 



She praised Parvana for managing to do all the shopping she was supposed to, but seemed to find it hard to look at her.
