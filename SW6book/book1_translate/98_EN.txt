Bones. They were going to dig up bones.



“I'm not sure this is a good idea,” Parvana told Shauzia the next morning.



She had brought the blanket and her father's writing materials.



She hadn't dared to tell her mother that they were going to dig up bones, 



so she had to take the things with her.



“It's good that you brought the blanket. 



We can use it to carry the bones.” 



Shauzia didn't listen to Parvana's objections. 



“Come on, then. We'd better hurry so we don't fall behind the others.”



Getting behind the others didn't sound so bad to Parvana, 



but after a quick glance up at the painted window of her secret friend across the marketplace, 



she obediently followed Shauzia as they ran to catch up with the rest of the group.



The sky was dark with clouds. 



They walked for almost an hour along streets that Parvana did not recognize.



Eventually, they arrived in one of the areas of Kabul most damaged by rockets.
