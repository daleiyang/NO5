Although she was happy to stay in Kabul, 



Parvana felt quite offended that they would not take her with them.



“I'm not happy with anything these days,” she told Shauzia the next day.



“Me neither,” said Shauzia. 



“I used to think that if I could just go around selling things from a tray, 



I'd be happy, but I'm not happy at all. 



This way I make more money than when I was a tea boy, 



but it's not enough to make any real change. 



We are still hungry. My family still fights all the time. 



Nothing has gotten better.”



“What can be done about it?”



“Maybe someone should drop a big bomb on the whole country so we could start from scratch.”



“They tried that,” said Parvana. “Then it just got worse.”



One of the women in the local chapter of the women's group was to accompany Parvana's family to the city of Mazar. 



Her husband would travel with them as their official companion. 



If the Taliban asked, mom would be her husband's sister and Nooria,



Maryam and Ali would be his nephews.



Nooria cleaned out the big cupboard one last time.
