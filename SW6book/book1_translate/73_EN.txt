Parvana spread the blanket on the hard mud of the marketplace, 



arranging the goods for sale on one side, as Dad used to do, 



and spread out the pens and writing paper in front of her. 



Then she sat down and waited for customers.



The first hour passed without anyone stopping.



Men walked by, looked down at her and kept walking.



She wished she had her chador to hide behind. 



She was sure that at any moment someone would stop, point at her and shout:



“Flicka!” The word would echo through the market like a curse, and everyone would stop what they were doing. 



Sitting there for the first hour was one of the hardest things she had ever done.



She sat and looked the other way when someone stopped. 



She felt the cold shadow of a man standing between her and the sun. 



When she turned her head, she saw the Taliban uniform, the dark turban. 



The man had a rifle slung across his chest, as slippery as her father's shoulder bag had hung over her own.



Parvana began to tremble.



“Can you read letters?” he asked in Pashto.



Parvana tried to answer, but her voice would not carry. She nodded instead.



“Speak up, boy! I have no use for a letter reader without a voice.”
