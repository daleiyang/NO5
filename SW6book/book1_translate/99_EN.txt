There was not a single undamaged house in the whole area, 



just piles of bricks, gravel and debris.



There had been bombs in the cemetery too.



The explosions had destroyed the graves. 



Here and there, the white bones of the long-dead poked out of the rust-brown soil. 



Flocks of large black and gray crows cawed and pecked at the ground around the destroyed graves in the newer part of the cemetery. 



The light wind carried the stench of decay to Parvana and Shauzia where they stood at the edge of the oldest part of the cemetery. 



They watched as the boys spread out between the graves and started digging.



Parvana noticed a man setting up a large scale next to a half-demolished house wall.



“Who is that?”



“That's the bone merchant. He buys the bones from us.”



“What does he want them for?”



“He's selling them to someone else.”



“Why would anyone want to buy bones?”



“What does it matter as long as we get paid?”



Shauzia handed Parvana one of the rough pieces of plank she had brought to use as a shovel.



“Let's get to work.”



They walked up to the nearest grave.



“But what if ... what if there's still a body there?” Parvana began.
