Parvana took a deep breath.



“I read letters,” she said in Pashto, in a voice she hoped was clear enough. 



“I can read and write in Dari and Pashto.”



If this was a customer, she hoped her Pashto would be good enough.



The Taliban continued to look at her. Then he put his hand inside his vest. 



Looking at Parvana, he pulled something out of his vest pocket.



Parvana was about to close her eyes in anticipation of being shot, 



when she saw that the Taliban had pulled out a letter.



He sat down next to her on the blanket.



“Read this,” he said. 



Parvana took the envelope from him. The stamp was from Germany. 



She read what was written on the outside.



“This is addressed to Fatima Azima.”



“She was my wife,” said the Taliban. 



The letter was very old. Parvana took it out of the envelope and unfolded it. 



The folds in the paper were worn.



“Dear niece,” Parvana read. 



“I'm sorry I can't come to your wedding, but I hope you get this letter in time. 



It is good to be in Germany, far away from the fighting.



But in my mind I have never left Afghanistan. 



My thoughts are constantly with our country, with family and friends I will probably never see again.
