Mrs. Weera had come back.



“I'll move in with you this afternoon, Parvana,” she said. “You can help me.”



Parvana wanted to go back to the blanket, but helping Mrs. Weera would also be a break from everyday life, so she was happy to do it. 



Besides, Mom was the same when Mrs. Weera was around.



“Mrs. Weera and I are going to work together,” Mom said. “We're going to start a newspaper.”



“So we will be busy with our work.



Nooria will look after the toddlers, your mother and I will work on our project, and you will go off to your work,” explained Mrs. Weera, 



as if she were making a team line-up on the field hockey pitch.



“Everyone pulls their weight.”



Parvana showed them the money she had earned.



“Wonderful!” Mom said. “I knew you could do it.”



“Dad would have earned much more,” said Nooria,



but then bit her tongue, as if she regretted it, and tried to swallow the words again.
