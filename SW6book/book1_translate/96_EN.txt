Nooria had lots of ideas about school. 



She had planned to train as a teacher after high school,



before the Taliban put a stop to her plans. 



When the schools had just closed, she and Parvana were taught by her father for a while, but he wasn't well so it fell through.



“I could teach math and history,” Nooria said. 



“Mrs. Weera can teach health and science, and Mom can teach you to read and write.” 



Parvana didn't like the idea of being taught by Nooria. 



As a teacher, she would be even more bossy than she already was as a big sister! 



But she couldn't remember the last time she had seen Nooria so eager and excited about anything, so she said nothing.



Parvana and Shauzia met almost every day at the market. 



Parvana waited for her friend to come over to her. 



She was still too shy to run off to the tea boys and look for her. 



They talked about one day having enough money to buy trays and things to sell, 



but none of them had yet figured out how to do it.



One day, as she sat waiting for customers,



something landed right on Parvana's head. 



She quickly grabbed it. After first checking that no one was watching her, 



she took a look at the latest gift from the woman in the window.
