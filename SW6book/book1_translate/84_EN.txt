She turned on the tap so that the water flowed. 



Maryam laughed. She stuck one hand into the jet, 



but immediately withdrew it when she felt the cold water against her skin. 



“Don't swallow,” Parvana warned her, showing her how to splash water on her face.



Maryam got more water on her clothes than on her face, but at least she had fun.



One turn was enough for Maryam the first time.



The next day, Parvana took Maryam's sandals to the market and used them as measurements when she bought a bigger pair. 



She found a second-hand pair that a man was selling on the street. 



Maryam then accompanied Parvana to the water tap every day, and gradually she got stronger.



The days became more and more similar. 



Parvana left for the market early every morning, 



returned home at lunchtime and then went back in the afternoon.



“I could stay if there was a toilet I could use at the market,” she said. 



“I still want you to come home in the middle of the day,” said mom. “I want to know you're okay.” 



One day, after working for a week, Parvana had an idea. 



“Mom, everyone thinks I'm a boy, right?”
