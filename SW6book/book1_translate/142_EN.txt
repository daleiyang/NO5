Mrs. Weera put her arms around Homa, but the girl was inconsolable. 



She cried until she collapsed and fell asleep exhausted.



Parvana could not move. She could not speak.



She envisioned her mother, sisters and younger brother lying dead in the street of a strange city.



“There is no evidence that your family has been harmed, Parvana,” said Mrs. Weera. 



“Your mother is a strong and wise woman, as is Nooria.



We must believe that they are alive. We must not give up hope!”



For Parvana, all hope was lost. She did what her mother had done. 



She curled up on her toshak, 



pulled a blanket over her and decided to stay there forever.



For two days she lay there on the toshak. 



“That's what the women in my family do when we're sad,” she told Mrs. Weera.



“They don't lie there forever,” said Mrs. Weera.



“They get back up and start resisting.”



Parvana did not answer. She did not want to get up again. 



She was tired of resisting.



At first, Mrs. Weera took care of her, but she was busy with Homa and her granddaughter.



Late in the afternoon of the second day, Shauzia showed up at Parvana's house.
