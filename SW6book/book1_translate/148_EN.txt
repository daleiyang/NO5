“I also have something to work for,” said Shauzia. 



“I am working to get out of Afghanistan.” 



“Won't you miss your family?” Parvana asked.



“Grandpa is looking for a man for me to marry,” replied Shauzia. 



“I overheard him talking to grandma. 



He said I should get married soon and since I'm so young, they'll get a good bride price for me



and then they'll have lots of money to live on.”



“But can't your mother stop him?”



“What could she do? She has to live at home with them. 



She has nowhere else to go.” Shauzia stopped and looked at Parvana.



“I can't get married! I don't want to get married!”



“How will your mother manage if you are not there? How will she get food?”



“What will I do?” moaned Shauzia.



“If I stay here and get married, my life is over.



If I leave, I might have a chance. 



There must be somewhere in the world where I can live. Is that all wrong?” 



She wiped the tears from her face. “Do I have any choice?”



Parvana did not know how to comfort her friend.



One day a visitor came to Mrs. Weera, a member of the women's group who had just left Mazar.
