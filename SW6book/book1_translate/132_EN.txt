Parvana and Mrs. Weera stood there waving until the truck drove out of sight.



“I think we could both do with a cup of tea now,” said Mrs. Weera, and they went up the stairs.



For Parvana, the next few weeks were strange. 



With only herself, Mrs. Weera and Mrs. Weera's grandchildren at home, the apartment felt almost empty.



Fewer people meant less to do, less noise and more free time. 



Parvana even missed Ali's whining. 



As the weeks went by, she looked forward to their return more and more.



But she still enjoyed having more time to herself. 



For the first time since Dad was arrested, 



she took his books out of the secret hiding place in the cupboard. 



In the evenings, she read and listened to Mrs. Weera's stories.



Mrs. Weera trusted her.



“In some parts of the country, girls get married and have children at your age,” she said. 



“I'm here if you need me, 



but if you want to take care of yourself, that's fine too.”



She was adamant that Parvana should keep part of her salary as pocket money. 



Sometimes Parvana would buy Shauzia lunch at one of the kebab stalls in the market.



They would find a sheltered place to use as a toilet and continue working all day. 



Parvana preferred to come home at the end of the day rather than for lunch.
