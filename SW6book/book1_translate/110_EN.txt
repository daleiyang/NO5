From that day on, she sent Parvana off to work with a small package of nan for lunch.



“Because you don't come back here in the middle of the day.”



But even though Parvana got very hungry in the middle of the day, 



she couldn't bring herself to eat in the middle of a graveyard. 



She gave her nan bread to one of Kabul's many beggars, so that someone would benefit from it.



After two weeks of work, they had enough money to buy their trays with straps to wear around their necks.



“We should sell things that don't weigh so much,” said Shauzia. 



They decided on cigarettes that they could buy in whole loaves and sell as loose packs. 



They also sold chewing gum, sometimes whole packs and sometimes loose.



Matchboxes filled up the empty spaces on the trays.



“My tea boy days are over!” Shauzia said cheerfully.



“I'm just grateful to have escaped the graveyard,” said Parvana. 



She was learning to walk and balance the tray at the same time. 



She didn't want all the nice things to fall into the dust on the ground.



She was back at her letter-writing job 



and the first morning was almost over when she felt something fall on her head again.
