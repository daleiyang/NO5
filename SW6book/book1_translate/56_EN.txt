“Is that all you bought? Where is the rice? Where is the tea?



How are we going to survive on this alone?”



“Don't be too hard on her. She was chased out of the market before she could finish shopping.” 



Mrs. Weera entered the room and took off her jar.



“Mrs. Weera!” Nooria exclaimed.



The relief was evident on her face. 



Here was someone who could take care of things, who could lift some of the responsibility from her narrow shoulders.



Mrs. Weera put down the baby she had been carrying next to Ali on the carpet. 



The two toddlers looked at each other warily.



Mrs. Weera was a tall woman. She had white hair, but a strong body. 



She had been a gym teacher before the Taliban forced her to stop working.



“What on earth is going on here?” she asked. 



With a few quick steps, she had gone to the washroom to find out what was smelling so bad. 



“Why haven't you washed these diapers?”



“We haven't had any water,” Nooria explained. “We haven't dared to go out.”



“But you're not afraid, are you, Parvana?” She did not wait for an answer.
