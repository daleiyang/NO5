“We are not even allowed to go out. How can we lead the men into battle?



I have seen enough war. I don't want to see any more.”



“There are many kinds of battles,” Dad said quietly.



“Including the battle for the dinner plate,” Mom said.



Parvana made such an ugly face that Dad started laughing. 



Maryam tried to imitate her, which made mom and Nooria laugh. 



Ali woke up, and when he saw everyone laughing, he burst out laughing too.



The family's best laugh came when four Taliban soldiers burst through the door.



Ali was the first to react. 



He was startled by the sound of the door crashing into the wall, and he screamed.



Mom jumped up, and in an instant Ali and Maryam were standing in the corner of the room behind her legs, screaming.



Nooria covered herself completely with her chador and curled up into a little ball. 



Young women were sometimes abducted by soldiers. 



They were dragged away from home and their families never saw them again.



Parvana could not move. She was frozen to the floor. 



The soldiers were huge, and with their high turbans they looked even taller.



Two of the soldiers grabbed her father. 



The other two started searching the apartment, kicking the remains of the evening meal all over the carpet.
