But she knew the answer immediately. 



She hadn't been able to leave unnoticed with four children.



“I just want to be a normal kid again,” said Parvana. 



“I want to sit in a classroom and go home and eat food that someone else has earned. 



I want my dad to be home. 



I just want a normal, boring life.” 



“I don't think I could ever sit in a classroom again,” said Shauzia. 



“Not after everything that has happened.” She straightened the tray of cigarettes.



“You won't tell anyone the secret, will you?”



Parvana shook her head. 



“Do you want to come with me?” Shauzia asked. “We could take care of each other.” 



“I don't know.” Afghanistan she could leave,



but could she leave her family? 



She didn't think so. “I have a secret too,” she said. 



She put her hand in her pocket and took out the small gifts from the woman in the window. 



She told Shauzia how she had gotten them.



“Wow,” said Shauzia. “What a mystery. I wonder who she could be. 



What if she's a princess?” 



“What if we can save her!” Parvana said. 



She envisioned herself climbing up the wall, 



smashing the painted window with her fist and helping the princess down to the ground.
