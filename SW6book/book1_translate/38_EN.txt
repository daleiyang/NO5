“Nooria, write a note to mom.”



“Don't worry about it, Nooria. 



I'm not going to walk around my own town with a note pinned to my burka like I'm a daycare kid. 



I have a university degree!”



“Write the note anyway,” Parvana whispered to Nooria when her mother was inside washing herself.



“I'll wear it on my sleeve.”



Nooria agreed. Her handwriting was more adult than Parvana's. She wrote quickly. 



I give my wife permission to be outside. She signed her father's name.



'I don't think it will do much good,' Nooria whispered as she handed the note to Parvana. 



“Most Taliban can't read.”



Parvana did not reply. She quickly folded the note into a small square and tucked it into her wide sleeve.



Nooria suddenly did something very unusual.



She gave her sister a hug.



“Come back,” she whispered.



Parvana didn't want to leave, but she knew it would be much harder to sit at home and wait for the others to come back.



“Hurry up, Parvana,” her mother said. “Your father is waiting for us.”
