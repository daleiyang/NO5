Parvana walked out of the store with rice and tea and was very proud of herself.



“I can do this!” she whispered.



In the vegetable stand, onions were cheap. She bought a few.



“Look what I brought!” Parvana exclaimed as she rushed through the door at home. 



“I did it! I went shopping, and no one tried to stop me.” 



“Parvana!”



Maryam ran up to her and gave her a hug. 



Parvana hugged her back as best she could with her arms full of food. 



Mom was once again lying on the toshak, facing the wall, her back turned to the room. 



Ali sat next to her, he patted her and said: “Mama-ma”, trying to get her attention. 



Nooria took the groceries from Parvana and handed her the water bucket.



“Since you have your sandals on,” she said.



“What's wrong with mom now?” 



“Shhh, not so loud! Do you want her to hear you? 



She was sad when she saw you in Hossain's clothes.



You can't blame her for that, can you? 



Besides, Mrs. Weera went to her house, and that made her sad. 



Now go and get some water, please.”
