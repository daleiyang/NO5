“How else could you look like a boy?” Mom asked. 



“Cut Nooria's hair! She is the oldest! It's her responsibility to take care of me, not mine to take care of her!”



“No one would believe I was a boy,” Nooria said calmly as she looked down at her body. 



Nooria's calmness only made Parvana angrier.



“I'll look like that soon too,” said Parvana.



“You think so.”



“We'll talk about that then,” Mom said quickly to deflect the argument she knew was in the air. 



“Until then, we have no choice. Someone has to go out,



and you're the one most likely to be mistaken for a boy.”



Parvana thought about it. 



She ran her hand up her back to feel how long her hair had gotten.



“You must decide for yourself,” said Mrs. Weera. ” 



We can make you cut your hair, but you're the one who has to go out and play your new role. 



We know it's a big thing to ask, but I think you can do it. What do you say?”



Parvana realized that Mrs. Weera was right. 



They could hold her down and cut off her hair, 



but when it came to everything else, they would have to rely on her cooperation.
