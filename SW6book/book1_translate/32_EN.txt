The kamiz was torn apart against the rough cement.



Then they disappeared around the corner, and she saw them no more.



Inside the room, the other two soldiers were cutting their toshaks with their knives and throwing things out of the cupboard. 



At the bottom of the cupboard was the secret compartment that Dad had built to hide the few books that had not been destroyed in the bombings.



Some were English literature and history books. 



They were kept hidden because the Taliban burned any books they didn't like. 



They were not allowed to find my father's books! 



The soldiers had started looking on the top shelf and worked their way down.



Clothes, blankets, bowls - everything ended up in a pile on the floor.



Now they were approaching the bottom shelf with the extra wall. 



Parvana watched in horror as the soldiers bent down to tear out the items on the bottom shelf.



“Get out of my house!” she shouted.



She threw herself at the soldiers with such force that they both fell to the floor. 



She pounded them with her fists until they pushed her away. 



She heard rather than felt them hitting her over the back with their sticks. 



She hid her head in her arms until the soldiers stopped hitting her and left.
