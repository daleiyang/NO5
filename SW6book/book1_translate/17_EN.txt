For short distances, Dad could manage with just his cane. 



When he walked longer distances, he needed to lean on Parvana.



“You're just the right height,” he said.



“What happens when I grow?”

Dad used to have a prosthetic leg, but he sold it. It wasn't meant to be. 



Prosthetic legs have to be specially ordered, and one person's prosthetic leg might not fit another. 



But when a customer saw my dad's leg on the blanket, he didn't care about the other things for sale and demanded to buy the leg. 



He offered such a good price that Dad finally gave in.



Now there were many prosthetic legs for sale on the market. 



Since the Taliban had decided that women had to stay at home, many husbands took their wives' prosthetic legs with them. 



“You're not going anywhere, so why do you need another leg?” they asked.



There were bombed-out houses all over Kabul. 



Homes and businesses in entire neighborhoods had been turned into bricks and gravel.



Kabul had once been a beautiful city.

shopping sprees for clothes and books in fancy stores.
