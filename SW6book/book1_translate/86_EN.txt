When no one else was around, Parvana kept watch so Nooria could unfold her burqa and let the sun shine on her face.



“I forgot how nice it is,” she said. 



When there was no queue at the water tap, Nooria washed the babies there so Parvana didn't have to carry so much water. 



Sometimes Mrs. Weera and her grandchildren would join her, and all three children would be washed at the same time.



Business was up and down. 



Sometimes Parvana had to sit and wait for hours without any customers coming. 



She earned less money than her father, 



but the family had enough to eat, even though they mostly just ate and drank tea. 



The children seemed more alert than they had in a long time. 



The daily sunlight and fresh air did them good, 



although Nooria said it was now harder to get them to be still indoors.



They were more energetic and always wanted to go out, but this was not possible when Parvana was out working.



Every night, Parvana left all the money she had earned. 



Sometimes her mother would ask her to buy something on the way home. 



Sometimes, and this was Parvana's favorite part, 



her mother would take her to the market to shop for the family - Mrs. Weera had finally managed to persuade her. 



Parvana liked having her mother to herself, 



even if they didn't talk about anything other than how much cooking oil to buy or whether they could afford soap this week.
