“We're out of food,” Nooria told Parvana again the next day.



“I'm not going out.”



“You have to go. There's no one else who can.”



“My feet still hurt.”



“Your feet will survive, but we won't unless you get us food. Now go away!”



Parvana looked at her mother, still lying on the toshak. 



She looked at Ali, exhausted from lack of food and longing for his parents. 



She looked at Maryam, who was already getting sunken cheeks and had not been out in the sun for so long. 



Finally, she looked at her older sister, Nooria.



Nooria looked terrified. 



If Parvana didn't do as she said, she would have to get food herself.



Now I have her, Parvana thought. I can make her as desperate as she usually makes me. 



But to her surprise, she discovered that this thought did not put her in a good mood. 



Maybe she was too tired and too hungry. 



Instead of ignoring the whole thing, she took the money from her sister's hand.



“What should I buy?” she asked.
