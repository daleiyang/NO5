Mom and Nooria were cleaning again. Dad kissed Ali and Maryam, 



went to the bathroom to wash off the dust and then stretched out on a toshak to rest.



Parvana put down her bun and started to take off her chador.



“We need water,” Nooria said.



“Can't I sit down for a while first?” Parvana asked her mother.



“The rest will be better when the work is done. Now go on.



The water tank is almost empty.”



Parvana groaned. If the tank was almost empty, she would have to go five times to the water tap. 



Six, because her mother hated the sight of an empty water bucket.



“If you had gone yesterday when mom asked you, you wouldn't have had to carry so much today”, 



Nooria said as Parvana walked past her to fetch the water bucket.
