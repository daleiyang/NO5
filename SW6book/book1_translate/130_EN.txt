Parvana watched as she packed up her things.



“If all goes well, we'll reach Mazar in a couple of days,” Nooria said.



“Are you scared?” Parvana asked. “It's a long journey.”



“I can't help thinking about all the things that could go wrong, but mom says everything will be fine.”



They would travel together in the back of a truck. 



“As soon as I get out of Taliban-controlled territory, I'm going to rip off my burqa and tear it into a million pieces.”



Parvana went to the market the next day to buy some food for the family to take on the trip.



She also wanted to buy a present for Nooria. 



She walked along the market stalls looking for things that were for sale. 



Finally, she decided on a pen in a beaded case. 



Every time Nooria used it at university and later when she finished teaching, she would think of Parvana.



“We'll be gone most of the summer,” her mother reminded Parvana the night before they left. 



“You will be fine with Mrs. Weera. 



Do as she says, and don't make any trouble.”



“Parvana and I will be fine together,” said Mrs. Weera, 



“and you will return at about the same time as the newspaper arrives from Pakistan,



printed and ready for distribution.”
