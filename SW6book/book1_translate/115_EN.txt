Parvana stayed home for a few days. 



She went to fetch water and she and Nooria took the toddlers out in the sunshine, 



but other than that she wanted to be with her family.



“I need a break,” she told her mom. 



“I don't want to see anything else nasty for a while.”



Mom and Mrs. Weera had heard about what had happened at the stadium from other members of the women's group. 



Some had husbands and sons who had been there.



“They do this every Friday,” said mom. “What kind of country are we living in?”



“Are they going to take Dad there?” Parvana wanted to ask, but she didn't. 



Her mother would not be able to answer that.



While she stayed at home, she practiced arithmetic with Maryam, 



tried to learn how to mend clothes from Nooria, and listened to Mrs. Weera's stories. 



They were not as good as Dad's stories. 



Mostly she described field hockey games or other sporting events.
