The British were winning, and the Afghans were about to give up. 



They had lost the will to fight, and they had no strength left to continue fighting. 



Surrendering and being captured was beginning to look like a good choice for them. 



At least they would get some rest and maybe it would save their lives.



Suddenly, a little girl, younger than Nooria, burst out of one of the houses in the village. 



She ran to the front and stood there facing the Afghan troops. 



She tore off her veil and, with the hot sun beaming down on her head and face, she shouted to the troops:



“We can win this battle!” she shouted. 



“Don't give up hope! Pull yourselves together! Let's go!” 



Waving her veil in the air like a battle flag, she led the troops in a final attack on the English.



The British didn't stand a chance. The Afghans won the battle.”



“You can learn from that, my daughters,” said Dad, looking from one to the other, 



“that Afghanistan has always been home to the bravest women in the world. 



You are all brave women. You have all inherited Malali's courage.”



“We can win this battle!” Maryam shouted, waving her arm as if she were holding a flag.



Mom put the teapot away just in case.



“How can we be brave?” Nooria asked.
