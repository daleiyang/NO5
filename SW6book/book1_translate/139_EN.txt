Finally she recognized herself and they continued home.



When they reached Parvana's street, she started running, dragging the woman with her. 



By then she was so scared that she was sure that if she didn't get home right away she would collapse on the ground.



“You're home again!” 



Mrs. Weera was so relieved that she hugged both Parvana and the woman before she realized what she had done.



“You've brought someone with you! Welcome back, my dear.” She scrutinized the woman. 



“You weren't walking around on the street like that, were you? Without a burka?”



Parvana explained what had happened.



“I think she's in trouble.”



Mrs. Weera did not hesitate. She put her arm around the woman.



“We'll save the details for later. 



There's hot water for you to wash in and hot food for dinner. 



But you don't look much older than Parvana!”



Parvana looked carefully at her companion.



She hadn't seen the woman's face in the light until now. 



She looked to be a little younger than Nooria.



“Fetch some clean clothes,” Mrs. Weera said to Parvana.



Parvana brought out a shalwar kamiz that belonged to mom from the cupboard, 



and Mrs. Weera took the young woman into the washroom and closed the door.
