‘Should I write a reply?’ Parvana asked. 



Her father used to say that too. 



The Taliban sighed and then shook his head.



‘How much do I owe?’



‘Pay whatever you want,’ said Parvana. Dad used to say that too.



The Taliban took some money out of his pocket and gave it to her. 


Without a word, he got up from the blanket and walked away. 



Parvana took a deep breath and let it out slowly. 



Until now, she had only seen the Taliban as the men who beat women and arrested her father.
