“Tell your mom to send newspapers to women all over the world. 



She has helped to let the whole world know what is happening in Afghanistan. 



Don't forget to tell her. What she has done is very important. 



And tell her that we want her to come back, 



that she's needed for the work on the next issue.”



“I'll tell her.”



She gave Mrs. Weera a hug. 



Both Mrs. Weera and Homa were wearing jars, but as she hugged them, she felt who was who.



It was time to leave. 



Suddenly, just as the truck was about to turn onto the road, Shauzia appeared.



“You made it!” Parvana said and hugged her friend.



“Goodbye, Parvana,” said Shauzia. 



She handed Parvana a bag of dried apricots. 



“I'm leaving soon too. 



I met some nomads who are going to pretend I'm a shepherd and take me to Pakistan. 



I won't wait until spring. It will be too lonely here without you.” 



Parvana did not want to say goodbye.



“When will I see you again?” she asked, terrified. “How will we keep in touch?”



“I've thought of that,” said Shauzia. 



“We'll meet again on the first day of spring in twenty years.”



“Yes, of course. Where will it be?”



“At the top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. I told you I was going to France.”
