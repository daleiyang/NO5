After all, what Nooria had said was true. 



None of her friends had seen her since the Taliban closed their school. 



Her relatives were scattered in different parts of the country, even in different countries.



There was no one to ask for her.



“You can put on Hossain's clothes.” 



Mom's voice got a little thick, and for a moment it seemed as if she was going to cry, but she collected herself again. 



“They'll be a bit too big for you, but we can sew them in a little if necessary.” She glanced at Mrs. Weera.



“Those clothes have lain unused long enough. It's about time they came in handy.”



Parvana guessed that Mrs. Weera and her mother had had long, lively discussions while she was asleep. 



She was glad of that. Mom already looked better. 



But that didn't mean she was going to give in.



“It's not going to work,” she said. 



“I won't look like a boy. I have long hair.”



Nooria opened the door of the cupboard, took out the sewing box and opened it slowly. 



Parvana thought Nooria seemed to be enjoying herself as she took out the scissors and flicked them in the air a few times.



“You're not going to cut my hair off, are you?” Parvana's hands flew up to her head.
