and next to it was the wash basin. 



There were other people living in the part of the house that had not collapsed. 



Parvana saw them when she went out to fetch water or accompanied her father to the marketplace. 



“We have to keep to ourselves,” her father had said. 



“The Taliban encourage people to spy on their neighbors. It's safer if we don't socialize with the others.”



Maybe it was safest, Parvana often thought, but it was also lonely. 



Maybe there was another girl her own age living nearby, but she would never know. 



Dad had his books, Maryam played with Ali, Nooria had Mom, but Parvana had no one.



Mom and Nooria had wiped the shelves in the cupboard. Now they put the things back.



“Here's a pile of things for your father to sell at the market. Put them by the door,” Mom told her.



Parvana saw a bright red cloth.



“My beautiful shalwar kamiz! We can't sell it!”



“I decide what we sell, not you. 



We no longer have any use for it, 



unless you're going to a party you haven't told me about, of course.”



Parvana knew there was no point in arguing.
