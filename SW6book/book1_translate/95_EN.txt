“The Taliban are not invited.” Mrs. Weera smiled at her own little joke.



“What will we learn?”



“Field hockey,” Parvana replied. “Mrs. Weera used to be a gym teacher.”



The idea of a secret field hockey school in their apartment was so crazy that everyone started laughing. 



Shauzia was still laughing when she left for home a few minutes later.



They had a lot to talk about at dinner that night.



“We have to visit her mother,” said mom. “I'd like to interview her for our magazine.”



“How are you going to make a newspaper?” Parvana asked.



Mrs. Weera answered the question.



“We smuggle the articles out to Pakistan and print it there. 



Then we smuggle it back a few copies at a time.”



“Who will do the smuggling?” Parvana asked, 



a little worried that they would force her to do it. 



If they could turn her into a boy, they might have other plans too.



“That's what other women in our organization do,” replied Mom. 



“We have had visitors while you were at the market. 



Some of our members are married to men who support our work and are happy to help.”
