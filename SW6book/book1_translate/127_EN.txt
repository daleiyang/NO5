Parvana had read the letter, but she still had lots of questions.



“Do you really want to do this?”



Nooria nodded.



“Just look at my life here. I hate the Taliban regime. 



I'm tired of looking after the little kids. 



My students meet so rarely that it's almost not worth it.



I have no future here. 



At least in Mazar I can go to school, 



be outdoors without having to wear a burqa and get a job. 



Maybe in Mazar I can have some kind of life. 



Yes, this is what I want to do.”



In the following days, there were many discussions about what would happen next. 



As she was out working, Parvana could not participate in the discussions. 



She was only informed of the plans when she returned home in the evening.



“We're going to the wedding in Mazar,” her mother said. 



“We can stay with your aunt during the wedding preparations. 



Then Nooria will go home to her new family.



We will return to Kabul in September.”



“But we can't leave Kabul!” Parvana exclaimed. 



“What about my father? What if he is released from prison and we are not here? 



Then he won't know where to look for us!”



“I will :be here,” said Mrs. Weera. 



“I can tell your father where you are and take care of him until you come back.”
