I ran back inside and hid in a closet. 



I sat there for a very long time.



I thought they were going to kill me too, but they had finished killing in our house. 



They were busy killing other people.



Finally I left the closet and went out of the house. 



There were bodies everywhere in the street. 



Some soldiers drove by in a truck. 



They forbade us to move the bodies of our family members or even to cover them. 



They said we had to stay inside.



I was so afraid they would come back and shoot me too! 



When it got dark, I ran out.



I ran from house to house trying to avoid the soldiers. There were bodies everywhere. 



The wild dogs had started eating some of them, 



so there were loose body parts on the sidewalks and in the streets. 



I even saw a dog dragging a human arm in its mouth!



I couldn't stand it any longer. A truck had stopped in the street. The engine was running. 



I jumped on the back and hid. 



Wherever the truck was going, it couldn't get any worse.



We drove for a very long time. When I finally got off, I was in Kabul. 



I made it from the truck to the house where Parvana found me.”



Homa started crying.



“I just left them! 



I left my mom and dad and my brother in the middle of the street for the dogs to eat them!”
