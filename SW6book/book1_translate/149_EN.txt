Parvana had been at work, but my father told me about the visit that evening.



“Many people have fled Mazar,” he said.



“They live in refugee camps outside the city.”



“Is that where mom is?”



“It's possible. We won't know anything until we go to the camps and look for them.”



“How could we do that? Are you well enough to travel?”



“I'll never be well enough,” said Dad, ”but we're going anyway.”



“When do we go?” Parvana asked.



“As soon as I can arrange transportation. 



Can you take a letter from me to the men who helped me get home from prison? 



With their help, we can probably leave in a few weeks.”



Parvana had wanted to ask her father something for a long time.



“Why did the Taliban let you go?”



“I don't even know why they arrested me. 



How can I know why they released me?”



Parvana had to settle for that answer.



Now her life was about to change again. 



She was surprised at how calm she felt. 



She thought it was because her father had come back.



“We will find them,” Parvana said with complete conviction. 



“We will find them and bring them back home.”
