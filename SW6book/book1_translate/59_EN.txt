“That's no way to keep team spirit,” said Mrs. Weera. 



“Nooria, go and wash the babies for dinner. Use cold water. 



We use this first boiled water for drinking.”



Parvana went out into the room and sat down. 



Mom sat up. She had put on clean clothes. 



Her hair was brushed and put up. 



She looked like Mom again, although she still seemed very tired.



It seemed like an eternity before Mrs. Weera handed Parvana a cup of plain boiled water.



“Be careful with it. It's very hot.”



She drank the water as soon as she could, got another cup and drank that too.



Mrs. Weera and her granddaughter stayed the night. 



As Parvana was falling asleep, she heard Mrs. Weera, Nooria and her mother talking quietly to each other. 



Mrs. Weera told them about Parvana's run-in with the Taliban.



The last thing she heard before she fell asleep was Mrs. Weera saying:



“I guess we have to find another way.”
