Ever since Mom had been forced to quit her job, she had become more and more irritable with each passing day.



Parvana put the clothes with the other things by the door. 



She ran her fingers over the beautiful embroidery. 



It had been given to her as an Eid gift by her aunt in Mazar-i-Sharif, a city in northern Afghanistan. 



She hoped her aunt would be angry with her mother for selling it.



“Why don't we sell Nooria's nice clothes? She's not going anywhere.”



“She'll need them when she gets married.”



Nooria made a superior face at Parvana. 



As an added insult, she tossed her head so that her long hair swayed back and forth.



“Whoever you marry will be sorry,” Parvana said. 



“He's going to have a snobbish template frog for a wife.”



“That's enough,” said Mom.



Parvana was furious. Mom always liked Nooria. Parvana hated Nooria, 



and she would have hated her mother too if she had not been her mother.



She was furious when she saw her mother pick up Hossain's clothes and put them on the top shelf of the closet. 



Mom always looked sad when she touched Hossain's clothes.



Nooria had not always been the oldest.
