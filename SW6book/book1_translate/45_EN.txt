Mom's feet were so bad from the long walk that she could barely get into the room. 



Parvana had been so preoccupied with her own pain and fatigue that she hadn't thought about what her mother had gone through.



Nooria tried to help, but her mother just waved her away. 



She threw the jar on the floor. Her face was stained with tears and sweat.



She collapsed on the couch where Dad had slept through dinner just yesterday.



Mom cried for a long, long time. 



Nooria wiped the part of her face that was not buried in the pillow.



She washed away the dirt from the wounds on mom's feet.



Mom acted as if Nooria was not there at all. 



Eventually Nooria put a thin blanket over her. 



It took a long time before mom stopped sobbing and finally fell asleep.



While Nooria tried to take care of mom, Maryam took care of Parvana. 



She tried to keep her tongue in her mouth as she carried a tub of water to Parvana. 



She did not spill a drop. 



She wiped Parvana's face with a washcloth that she couldn't quite wring out. 



Water from the washcloth ran down Parvana's neck. The water felt good.
