The Taliban are not making Afghanistan a friendlier country to live in!‚Äù he said.



Although bombs were still falling on Kabul, they were not falling as often as before. 



There was still a war going on in the north of the country, 



and that's where most of the killing was taking place these days.



After a few more customers had come and gone, 



Dad suggested they stop work for the day.



Parvana got up quickly, but had to sit down again.



Her foot was asleep. She massaged it and then tried to get up again. 



This time she managed to stand up.



First, she collected all the little things they were trying to sell - crockery, pillowcases, trinkets that had survived the bombings. 



Like many Afghans, they tried to sell what they could. 



Mom and Nooria regularly went through the family's belongings to see what they could do without. 



There were so many people selling things in Kabul that Parvana was surprised there was anyone still willing to buy.



Dad put the pens and writing paper in his shoulder bag. 



He leaned against the cane and grabbed Parvana's arm and slowly stood up.



Parvana shook the sand out of the blanket, folded it up and off they went.
