Mom got up from the floor and was busy with Ali. 



Nooria was still curled up like a terrified ball. 



It was Maryam who came over to help Parvana. 



When her sister's hands touched her, Parvana flinched at first, thinking it was the soldiers. 



Maryam stroked her hair until Parvana realized who it was. 



She sat up and her whole body ached. 



She and Maryam clung to each other, trembling.



She had no idea how long the family sat like that. 



They stayed that way long after Ali, exhausted, had stopped screaming and fallen asleep.
