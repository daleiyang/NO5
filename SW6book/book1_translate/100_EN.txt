“I mean, what if it hasn't turned into bones yet?”



“We dig where the bones stick up.”



They walked around looking for a while. It didn't take long.



“Spread out the blanket,” Shauzia told her. 



“We'll put the bones in a pile on top and tie it into a bundle.”



Parvana spread out the blanket, 



but wished she had been at the market instead, sitting on the blanket under the window where her secret friend lived.



The two girls looked at each other, each hoping the other would start digging first.



“We're here to make money, right?” Shauzia said.



Parvana nodded. “Let's get started then.”



She grabbed the bone sticking out of the ground and pulled. 



It came out of the ground like a carrot you pull up in the garden. Shauzia threw it on the blanket.



Not wanting Shauzia to get the upper hand, 



Parvana grabbed the board and started scraping away the soil. 



The bombs had already done much of the work for them. 



Many of the bones were barely covered in dirt and were easy to get at.



“Do you think they would mind if we did this?” Parvana asked.



“Who would?



'The ones buried here. 



Do you think they would mind if we dug them up?”
