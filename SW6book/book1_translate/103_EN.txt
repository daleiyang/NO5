my father used to say. 



“Landmines are as common as rocks and can tear you apart without warning. 



Remember what happened to your brother.”



Parvana remembered when someone from the United Nations had come to school and shown a poster with different types of landmines. 



She tried to remember what they looked like. 



All she could remember was that some looked just like toys; 



special mines for blowing up children. 



Parvana peered through the doorway into the darkness. 



Sometimes soldiers would plant mines in houses before they left. 



Could someone have planted a landmine here? 



Would she be blown up if she went in?



She knew she had three choices.



She could wait to pee until she got home.



That was impossible, now she really couldn't hold it any longer. 



Or she could pee outside where she risked being seen by other people who would then guess she was a girl. 



The third option was to step into the dark, 



pee in peace and hope she didn't get blown up.



She chose the third. 



She took a deep breath and, saying a quick prayer, crossed the threshold. 



She did not explode.



“No landmines?” Shauzia asked as Parvana returned.
