Author's commentary



Afghanistan is a small country in Central Asia. 



It is home to the Hindu Kush Mountains, rushing rivers and golden deserts. 



Its fertile valleys once produced an abundance of fruit, wheat and vegetables. 



Throughout history, conquerors and explorers have regarded Afghanistan as the gateway to the Far East.



Afghanistan has been at war since 1978, when US-backed warlords rebelled against the Soviet-backed government there. 



In 1980, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan and the war escalated as both sides began bombing and killing with modern weapons.



After the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, a civil war broke out as different groups fought for power in the country.



Millions of Afghans became refugees, and many still live in large camps in Pakistan and Iran.



Many people have spent their entire lives in these camps. 



Millions have been killed, maimed and lost their sight.



Twenty years of war have also destroyed roads, bridges and waterways.
