On her way home, Parvana stopped at the water tap.



Her clothes were dirty. 



She washed them as best she could while still wearing them. 



She took the money out of her pocket and divided it into two piles. 



Some she put back in her pocket to give to her mother. 



The rest she hid at the bottom of her shoulder bag under her father's writing paper. 



Finally, she put her whole head under the tap



and hoped the cold water would wash away the memories of what she had been doing all day. 



But every time she closed her eyes, she saw Mr. Skull and his comrades lined up on the tombstone, grinning at her.
