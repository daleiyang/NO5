When a customer spoke Pashto, she understood most of it, but not all. 



Her parents could also speak English.

In the marketplace, there was a lot going on. 



Men shopped for their families and vendors offered their goods and services. 



Some had their own stalls, like the tea seller. 



With such a big tea kettle and so many trays of bricks, they had to stay in one place. 



The boys ran back and forth through the maze of the marketplace, bringing tea to the customers who couldn't leave their own shops and then running

She would have liked to run around the market,



find her way through the winding streets as well as between the four walls of her home.



Her father turned and looked at her.



“I'd rather see you running around a schoolyard.” 



He turned away again and called out to the passing men. 



“Writing everything! Reading everything! Pashto and Dari! Come and buy beautiful things!”
