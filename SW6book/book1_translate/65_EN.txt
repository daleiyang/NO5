She took off her own clothes and put on her brother's. 



Hossain's shalwar kamiz was light green, both the big shirt and the baggy pants. 



The shirt reached very far down, and the pants were too long, but if she rolled them up at the waist it was fine.



There was a sewn-in pocket on the left side of the shirt, near the chest. 



It was just big enough for money and some candy, if she ever got candy again. 



There was another pocket in the front.



It was nice to have pockets again. 



On her girls' clothes there were none. 



“Parvana, aren't you almost done?”



Parvana stopped looking in the mirror and walked out to her family.



The first face she saw was Maryam's. 



Her little sister looked as if she didn't quite know who it was that had come into the room.



“It's me, Maryam,” said Parvana.



“Parvana!” Maryam laughed as she recognized her.



“Hossain,” her mother whispered.



“You look less ugly as a boy than as a girl,” Nooria said quickly. 



If her mother started to remember Hossain, she would just start crying again.



“You look good,” said Mrs. Weera.



“Put this on.”



Mom handed Parvana a cap.
