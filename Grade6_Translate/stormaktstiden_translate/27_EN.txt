Silver in Nasa mountain.
In 1634, Peder Olofsson and his wife found silver ore in Nasa mountain near the Norwegian border. 
Axel Oxenstierna was delighted and had a mine opened there. 
The silver became money that was used to pay for wars in Europe. 
The Sami were forced to work in the mine, transporting the ore six miles from the mine to the smelter where the silver was smelted. 
This prevented the Sami from doing their own work with reindeer, hunting and fishing.
If they refused, they could get into trouble.
The undermine master Isak Tiock had workers at the mine throw some of the Sami into a river near the mine. 
This is how the workers tell it: “We tied a couple of reins around them, pushed them down the rapids a few trips (times) and then pulled them up, so that the water went out of their mouths again” (they vomited up the water).
Isak Tiock tormented the Sami for years. 
Many Sami fled. Eventually Isak was taken to court and deposed. 
Although the state treated the Sami harshly, they were able to win in court. 
The Sami remembered the wicked Isak for a long time. They told tales of his punishments for hundreds of years. 
The Nasa mountain mine was eventually closed because there was not much silver.
A book about the Sami.
Uppsala professor Johannes Schefferus was commissioned by nobleman Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie to write a book about the Sami. 
Priests in Norrland sent him descriptions. 
A Sami student helped him with jojkar, the special songs of the Sami. 
Here is the front cover of Schefferus' book Lapponia from 1673.
Why was Lars executed so cruelly?
