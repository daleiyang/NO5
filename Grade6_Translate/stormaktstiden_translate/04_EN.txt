1. the age of great power

On November 6, 1632, Sweden's King Gustav II Adolf led the Swedish army against the Emperor's troops.
It was to be a bloody battle outside the German village of Litzen.
The Swedish king wanted to prevent the German emperor from gaining power over the Baltic Sea.

Gustav Adolf rode his brown horse Streiff. It was foggy. 
Suddenly the king was shot in the left elbow. 
Streiff was hit by a shot in the neck. 
With the king on his back, the horse bolted into the fog and gun smoke, straight into the enemies. 
The king was surrounded by enemy horsemen. 
One of them shot him in the back.
He was stabbed in the chest by a sword and fell off Streiff. 
The king was killed as he lay on the ground.
Streiff galloped away. The horse was captured but died on the way home to Sweden.

Gustavus Adolphus had decided that his things should be kept as historical mementos. 
So Streiff was stuffed.
Now you can see him at the Livrustkammaren museum in Stockholm, along with the bloody clothes the king wore when he died. 
The picture at the top is a photo of a famous painting called 'Gustav Adolf's Death at the Battle of Litzen'.
