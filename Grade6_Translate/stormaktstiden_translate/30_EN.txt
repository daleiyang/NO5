The court and science.
Queen Kristina wanted Swedish court life to impress the rest of Europe. 
She gathered Swedish noblewomen and noblemen and many foreign guests at her court. 
She organized large parties with music, theatre and ballets. 
Foreign artists, dancers and theater companies were invited to the court to perform.
The courtiers and Kristina herself sometimes took part in ballets dressed in expensive clothes. 
At Kristina's coronation and other celebrations, fireworks and animal fights were organized.
Both Swedish and foreign guests have written about the great celebrations, thus leaving traces for our time.
Kristina and the philosopher.
Christina invited many learned foreign people to her court in Stockholm. 
The most prominent of these was the French philosopher Descartes (pronounced Dekarrt). 
He is best known for the words “Cogito ergo sum”, which is Latin for “I think, therefore I exist”.
Descartes didn't want to go to Sweden, but he didn't dare say no to the Queen of Sweden.
In Stockholm, he had to get up early in the morning to meet the Queen. 
When he crossed the bridge to the palace, the wind blew cold under his coat. 
Then he had to stand in an ice-cold room and talk to the Queen. 
Descartes fell ill and contracted pneumonia. 
He died after only a short time in Sweden.
Kristina's coronation party went on for many days. 
One day there was to be an animal fight. 
A lion was to fight a bear!
But the animals did not want to fight.
Instead, the lion went to bed to rest. 
The priest Jonas Petri, who was in the audience, wrote about the event in his diary.
