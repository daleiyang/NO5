6. KING XII AND THE END



On the afternoon of May 7, 1697, the royal palace of Tre kronor in Stockholm caught fire. 



Karl XI had died a month earlier and was lying in a coffin in the palace. 



His coffin was carried out and saved from the fire. 



The royal family ran out, but the Dowager Queen Hedvig Eleonora was so shocked that she had to be carried. 



The fire continued throughout the evening and night. 



Many old books, paintings and furniture were destroyed. 



Some were carried out and others were saved by throwing them out of the windows. 



People gathered from all over the city to watch. The fire could not be stopped. 



The three-crowned spire collapsed to the ground and the castle burned down. 



Was it a sign that Sweden's era of great power was coming to an end?



A young king



Charles XI's son, Charles XII, inherited the throne at the age of 14.



At just 15, he was declared an adult and became an absolute king. 



Drawings and homework books from Charles XII's childhood have survived.



Here he has written the names of some animals in Latin and Swedish and drawn them.
