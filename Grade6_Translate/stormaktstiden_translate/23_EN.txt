The poor in Stockholm.
Many war widows in the countryside had difficulty feeding themselves and their children. 
They migrated to the city to find work.
Often they were forced to beg. 
The city councils didn't like this because they wanted to keep order on the city streets. 
They tried to force the beggars to leave the cities. 
One woman and her three children begging in Stockholm were driven seven miles outside the city where they were dropped off and left to fend for themselves.
Barnhuset in Stockholm.
Beggar children in Stockholm were collected and put in the orphanage. 
Life was so hard at the orphanage that many children died. 
The children were often sick and wounded. 
One woman smeared the children's heads with an anti-scabies and vermin cream. 
When she pulled off the hardened smear, it hurt so much that the children first had to drink brandy to anesthetize themselves. 
The children were given nicknames that were used at the orphanage. 
Girls could be called Blueberry, Deerberry or Rose.
Boys were called Painter, Fox or Quiet.
At the orphanage, children learned to read, pray to God and work hard. 
Girls were taught to sew, spin and knit mittens and socks.
The boys learned different crafts.
When they were about 14, they were given work outside the orphanage. 
It was good that the orphanage children learned to read. 
Otherwise, it was mostly city families with money who could afford to send their children to a proper school.
Was it better to be in the orphanage than to be a beggar?
