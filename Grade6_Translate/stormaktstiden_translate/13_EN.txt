Mercenaries Peter

One of the emperors was the German Peter Hagendorf. 
He was at the Battle of Breitenfeld. 
Peter escaped after the battle but was captured by the Swedes. 
Now he had to fight for the Swedes, but when they were defeated in a later battle, he rejoined the Emperor's army. 
The important thing for a mercenary was to get paid and be able to plunder, not who won the war. 
Peter was unusual because he kept a diary. In it you can find out what life was like as a mercenary.

Peter and his family
The mercenaries marched constantly. They were followed by the troop.
The troops were wagons with food, gunpowder, bullets and grenades. 
The mercenaries could not go back the way they had come because they had already looted and exhausted the food there.

Like many other mercenaries, Peter had his family with him, who provided food and places to sleep.
But Peter's whole family died: his wife Anna, his children Elisabeth and Barbara, and a young son who was not baptized.

Boys could be helpers for mercenaries. Peter's helper was called Bartelt.
He kept Peter's equipment and the things Peter had looted in order.

A helper.

Looting

People living in war-torn areas suffered greatly. 
Peasant families hated the soldiers who beat, killed, raped and took anything valuable they came across. 
In southern Germany, the peasants got hold of fifty soldiers in the Swedish army and cut off their hands, feet, noses and ears. 
In retaliation, the Swedish army burned down 200 peasant villages in a single day. 
It is believed that over a quarter of all people in Germany were killed in the war.

Most died of disease and starvation.
