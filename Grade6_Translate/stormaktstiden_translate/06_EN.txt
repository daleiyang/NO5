The Netherlands

The city of Amsterdam was the center of European trade. 
The Dutch had trading posts around the world: 
in North America, in South America, in Africa and in Asia as far as Japan. 
They also carried many goods on their trading ships to and from Swedish ports.

Sweden and Europe 

Sweden was large in area but had no more than 1 million inhabitants. 
This was very few compared to, for example, Germany and France, which had 16 million inhabitants each. 
Nevertheless, Sweden became an important country in Europe during the period of the Great Powers. 
Sweden traded with many European countries and sold the most copper and iron in Europe. 
All countries needed copper and iron, for example to make cannons, weapons and ships.
Sweden fought in Denmark, Poland, Russia and Germany.
The Swedish armies were located far down in Europe. 
When the Swedish nobles returned from the wars, they brought new ideas and spoils back to Sweden. 
The spoils of war could be furniture, art, books and sculptures from castles and cities in other countries.

The 17th century was a turbulent time in Europe with many wars.
Wars could be about trade, politics or religion.
Countries fought against countries, Catholics against Protestants,
emperors against petty princes and peasants against nobles. 
Professional soldiers called mercenaries roamed Europe fighting for whoever paid the most.

But the 17th century was also a time when the world was explored by scientists with telescopes and described with mathematics. 
In castles, there was theater and ballet. 

France
France was the richest country in Europe. 
The French king Louis XIV was called King Sol. 
He introduced many new habits and fashions. 
For example, he wore a long, curly wig. 
The great Palace of Versailles, which he had built outside Paris, became the fashion in Europe, including Sweden. 
The Swedish nobility were happy to follow French fashion.
