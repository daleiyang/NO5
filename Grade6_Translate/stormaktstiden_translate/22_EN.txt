Order in the city.
In the 17th century, many new towns were founded in Sweden. 
The old medieval towns had narrow, winding alleys. 
Now there was to be order and tidiness. 
The new towns had straight streets and square blocks. 
One example is Gothenburg, which was founded in the early 17th century. 
King Gustav II Adolf had invited Dutch people to help build the city and become merchants there. 
People from many other countries, such as Germany, Scotland and England, also lived in the city. 
Gothenburg was Sweden's western gateway to the great oceans. 
Ships from all over the world came here.
On this map of Gothenburg from 1644, you can see the square blocks and a defensive wall built in a zigzag pattern.
The Dutch also made sure to dig canals in the city.
Burkus and the monkey.
In court records from Gothenburg, you can read about exciting things that happened in the city.
The bricklayer Burkus Schwartskopf was working on a rooftop in Gothenburg one day in 1695. 
He was suddenly attacked by a monkey that bit him on the head several times. 
The monkey had escaped from a nearby tavern where it was kept as entertainment for the guests. 
The owner of the tavern was fined and the sentence was reduced. Therefore, today we know what happened to Burkus and that the monkey existed.
Anna and the thief.
Many people were poor in Gothenburg. 
One of them was Anna Tolsdotter who was around 11 years old. 
She sold bread in the market square.
One May day in 1697, a soldier tried to steal bread from her.
Anna pulled out a knife and stabbed the soldier in the arm. 
She was taken to court. 
As she was poor and young, her only punishment was to pay for the soldier's medical treatment.
