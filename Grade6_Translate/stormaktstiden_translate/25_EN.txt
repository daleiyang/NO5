Geometric Map.
Here is a map from 1640 showing Ullfors village in northern Uppland. 
There were six farms in the village, fields, fences, a river with a bridge and a mill. 
Maps like this are called geometric maps. 
The maps were made to find out how much each farm could pay in taxes to the king.
The map was made by the surveyor Sven Månsson. 
The rules for the surveyors told them how to measure the farmers' land and calculate the area. 
They measured fields and meadows with measuring chains. 
They also drew in mills, streams, forests, beaches and sometimes old burial mounds. 
They had to be friendly to the farmers and socialize with them “without any poking and prodding”. 
The maps were drawn clean and colored for clarity. 
They are often beautiful and they are important traces of 17th century farmers.
Cheating with aerial photos! Here is the same village today.
Why are the church books and maps good traces?
