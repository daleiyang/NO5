In this painting, Princess Kristina is just 7 years old.
At Norrmalmstorg in front of the palace, the procession went through a large triumphal arch. 
It was made of wood and paper but painted to look like stone.
Nobles get a lot of land.
The nobles who fought for Sweden wanted to be paid. Kristina had no money. 
Instead, she gave away or lent them state-owned farms both in Sweden and in conquered areas. 
This meant that many of the peasants had to work for the nobles and pay taxes to them. 
Kristina also gave noble titles and gifts to the nobility. 
The other estates resented the increased power and wealth of the nobility. 
The priests complained in Parliament. A few peasants rebelled.
But the rebellions were put down by Kristinas's soldiers, and some of the peasants were executed. 
You can read about this in parliamentary minutes, letters and the diaries of noblemen.
Abdication.
The nobles wanted Kristina to marry so that the country would have a king.
But she didn't want to marry and have a husband who ruled over her. 
In secret, Kristina had become a Catholic. 
This did not suit Protestant Sweden, especially as her father was a hero among the Protestants. 
So in 1654 she abdicated, that is, renounced the crown. 
Her cousin Charles Gustav became king. 
Kristina took many precious things with her and moved to Rome. 
She died there in 1689 and was buried in St. Peter's Basilica.
Was there a big difference between being King and Queen?
