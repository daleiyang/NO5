New Sweden
Poor Swedish and Finnish peasants and some criminals moved to New Sweden and avoided prison if they came with them.
At most, 600 people lived in the colony.
It was only two miles wide and ten miles long. 
The farmers bought and took land from the Indians who already lived in the area.
There was trouble between the Swedes and the Dutch, who had their own colony nearby. 
The Dutch felt that the Swedes were encroaching on the land they wanted as colonies. 
In 1655, the Dutch conquered New Sweden.
Then the English took over the colony.
The Swedish farmers remained under new rule. 
They spoke Swedish right into the 18th century. 
Then their children went to English schools and wanted to speak English at home too. 
Then Swedish died out.

Cabo Corso in Africa

Sweden also acquired a colony in Africa, where Ghana is today. 
It was called Cabo Corso and served as a trading post. 
The Swedes built a fort and bought gold and ivory which they sold on. 
The Swedes also sold Africans as slaves to Portuguese colonies and others. 
After just a few years, the Dutch conquered Sweden's colony in Africa.
