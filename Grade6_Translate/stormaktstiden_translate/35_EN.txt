Swedish history.
Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie was very interested in Swedish history and historical research. 
He thought it was important to preserve Swedish history and ancient monuments. 
It gave glory and honor to the great power Sweden. 
His friend, the scientist Olof Rudbeck at Uppsala University, wrote a thick book in which he claimed that Sweden was the oldest kingdom in the world and that all peoples originally came from Sweden. 
During Magnus Gabriel's time, there was also a law forbidding people to destroy ancient remains. 
The law is still in place.
Hunting for giant tracks.
All priests were asked to interview peasants about legends, memories and ancient remains in their parishes.
What the priests wrote are called 'rannsakningar'. 
Many of them can still be read today.
Scientists believed, for example, that giants had once lived in Sweden but had died out. 
So they wanted the priests to specifically ask the peasants if they had seen traces of 'giants, giant graves, giant burrows, giant bones or their swords and weapons'. 
People thought that the large boulders had been thrown by giants. 
They did not know that there had been an ice age in Sweden.
Why was Swedish history important during the Great Power era?
And now comes show number 297!
Magnus Gabriel sent his secretary to Läckö Castle to the old lady Ingierd Gunnarsdotter.
He had to write down 300 old songs that she knew by heart. 
They are still in the Royal Library in Stockholm today.
The nobility collected unusual objects but did not always know what they were.
The objects were shown to guests. 
This was thought to be a unicorn horn. 
Actually, it was a tooth from a narwhal.
