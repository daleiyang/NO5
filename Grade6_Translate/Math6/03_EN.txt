How to use Mathematics Gamma



MATHEMATICS GAMMA contains five chapters, which in turn are divided into sections.



The sections contain tasks at three levels of increasing difficulty. 



With the help of your teacher, you choose a level that suits you. 



You can work at different levels in different sections or chapters. 



If you find LEVEL ONE too difficult, you can start working in GAMMA BASE with easier tasks. 



If you want more and more difficult tasks after LEVEL THREE, you can continue in GAMMA CHALLENGE.



Tasks where it is appropriate to use a calculator have a calculator marker.



Chapters include:



Ingress - A short diagnosis that shows what you already know and can help you choose a level. 



There is also a list of mathematical concepts from the chapter.



Theory and examples 



- All sections include theory to explain and examples to show how tasks can be solved and presented.



Communication boxes 



-In many of the examples, there are boxes where we have written what you can think about to present your solutions in a good way. 



We call these K-boxes.



Activities - Practical tasks to solve in pairs or in groups.



Clues - For some tasks, there are clues that you can use to help you. 



These tasks are marked with an L.



Pair or group tasks 



- Tasks that you might find useful to think about on your own first and then talk about with others. 



These tasks are marked with *.



Once you have done Mixed Tasks and a Diagnosis, move on to Practice or Develop.



Focus on helps you develop one or two long-term math goals at a time.



The chapters end with a Summary of key concepts and methods.



After Chapter 5, there is a Worksheet that you can use to check your answers.



At the end of the book you can work with Programming exercises, without using a computer.
