Animals conquer land

Just like today, 300 million years ago amphibians depended on the proximity of water to mate. 

But animals evolved that could lay eggs with shells made of lime. 

They were therefore able to live their entire lives on land and were true land animals. 

They were reptiles, and the first ones were small, warm-blooded lizards. 

This means that their body temperature was the same as that of their surroundings, just like reptiles today. 

During the cool nights they were still and during the hot days they moved quickly. 

There was also a very special lizard that had a large fin on its back. 

It turned its fin towards the sun to catch more sunlight and so could raise its body temperature. 

When the lizard was warm, it became much faster.

Reptiles could protect themselves from enemies in different ways. 

Some escaped by running and some by jumping. 

Some had strong leathery shells or strong bony shields, like the tortoise.

The iguana is a reptile similar to its ancestors.

TURTLES WITH SHIELDS. The oldest fossil found of a turtle is over 200 million years old. 

Although the turtle of that time looked a little different from today's, its hard shell protected it then as now from enemies.

Most turtles live in water, but breathe air and have to rise above the surface to breathe. 

They also come up on land to lay eggs. 

They have a toothless mouth shaped like a beak.

BIRDS. This is a cormorant chick. When you see it, it's easy to think that the ancestors of our birds were the flying lizards. 

But a plausible theory is that birds evolved from the small, bipedal dinosaurs instead. 

At the end of the 19th century, fossils were found in Germany that seemed to support this theory. 

In a limestone quarry, a fossil of a bird was found that had a tail and a mouth with teeth. 

It has since been called the primordial bird.
