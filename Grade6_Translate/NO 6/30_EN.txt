Movement

A jogger jogs past you, a car passes a pedestrian crossing. A bird dives for something on the ground. 
You ride your bike at a comfortable speed while the earth spins around the sun and rotates on its own axis.
Everything is moving. Movement means that something is moving in some way.

Speed

A bike ride around the lake takes maybe two hours. What speed do you cycle at? 
To answer that question, you need to know how far it is around the lake. 
Let's say it's 30 km. Then you cycle 30 km in 2 hours. That's 15 km in one hour, or 15 km/h.

When you indicate how fast how fast something is moving, it is called speed or velocity. 
Do you cycle as fast all the time? Probably not. 
You slow down at junctions and speed up when going downhill or on a straight stretch. 
The speed of 15 km/h is therefore an average value, an average speed or an average speed.

Units of speed

Speeds are always expressed in distance/time units. The most common units are kilometers per hour (km/h) or meters per second (m/s). 
When driving a car, the speed is indicated in km/h on the speedometer and on road signs. 
Common speed limits are 100 km/h on highways, 60 km/h on minor roads and 30 km/h outside schools and in residential areas.

Acceleration

The race cars stand still on the starting line. Bang! The starting gun goes off. 
After a few seconds the speed is over 100 km/h and after a few more seconds all cars are up to speeds over 300 km/h. 
Increasing your speed is called accelerating. Decelerating is called decelerating instead.

The speedometer shows that the car is traveling at 120 km/h. 

A bicycle can accelerate downhill.

Usain Bolt has run 100 meters in 9.58 seconds. This corresponds to a speed of 38 km/h.
