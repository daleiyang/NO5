Circular motion

The sledgehammer in the ring is spinning faster and faster. She holds her sledgehammer tightly. 
She wants to spin around as fast as she can. Soon it will happen: 
She will let go of the sledgehammer and it will continue straight ahead and land far away from the ring. 
The faster she spins, the more force she has to use to hold the sledgehammer. 
That force is in the direction of the arm towards the center of the ring. 
It is the same force that is present in all circular movements.

If it disappears, the sledgehammer continues straight ahead, so when the sledgehammer thrower lets go, the sledgehammer will continue straight ahead from where she let go.

When you drive a car, you should be grateful that there is a force that keeps the car on the road when cornering. 
That force comes from the friction between the tires and the road surface. 
The curve is part of a circle, so it is a circular motion.

If that force is suddenly released, like when the sledgehammer drops its hammer, the car goes straight ahead and probably into the ditch. 
This can happen, for example, if there is ice on the road, as ice reduces the friction between the road surface and the tires.

The red arrows show the force acting on the car in the curve, which helps to keep the car on the road. 
The black arrow shows the direction of the car if it slips on the ice patch.
