Think about it. The Moon and Earth are at approximately the same distance from the Sun.

? Why is there life on Earth but not on the Moon?

The solar system

The Earth is one of several planets orbiting the Sun. 

Our neighbors in space are the Sun, the Moon and other planets.

Our solar system also includes comets, meteors, asteroids and the moons of other planets.

The sun

Our Sun is actually a star, our nearest star. The Sun is a medium-sized star; 
there are both smaller and larger stars in the Universe. 
The fact that the sun gives us light and heat makes it possible for us to live on Earth. 
During the day, when our sky is bright, the Sun shines on our side of the Earth. 
At night, when our sky is dark, the Earth has rotated so that the sun shines on the other side of the Earth.

The picture shows a model of our Sun with all the planets orbiting it. 
The sun gives off heat and light, but it also throws out charged particles. 
These are called solar storms, solar winds and solar flares.
