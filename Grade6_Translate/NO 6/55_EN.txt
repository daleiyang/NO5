The phylogenetic tree of the plant kingdom

As with animals, plants are classified into several groups.

In simple terms, they are divided into algae, mosses and vascular plants. 

Both algae and mosses have no roots, while vascular plants have roots. 

The roots take up water and nutrients for the plant. 

Therefore, vascular plants are well adapted to living on land and in dry places.

Plants are also divided according to how they spread. 

For example, seed plants spread by seeds, while ferns spread by spores. 

But the division does not stop there. 

Seed plants are in turn divided into two groups depending on where they have their seeds. 

Apple trees have their seeds hidden inside the fruit, in the apples. Apple trees are said to be seedless. 

Other plants have naked seeds and are therefore called naked-seeded. 

One example is the spruce, where the seeds sit unprotected on the cones.

Fungi

Fungi are neither plants nor animals. They form a group all of their own. 

Many people think they are plants, but they actually have more in common with animals. 

They cannot produce nutrients themselves through photosynthesis, as plants can. 

To get nutrients, they can break down parts of dead plants and animals. 

Some fungi obtain nutrients by living in interaction with plants or as parasites on plants and animals.

Lichens

Lichens are a rather special organism. 

A lichen is an alga and a fungus that live together. 

The alga is a plant that feeds the fungus through photosynthesis. 

The fungus, in turn, absorbs water and acts as a shelter for the algae.

What is visible of the lichen is the sponge. The algae live inside the sponge to avoid drying out.

The lichen is therefore both a plant and a fungus. 

For the sake of simplicity, however, it is usually counted as a fungus.
