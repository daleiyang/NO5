Measuring distances

To measure distances in space, strong light signals are sent out, for example by laser. 

The signals bounce off the celestial body and come back. Since we know how fast the light is traveling, we can then calculate the distance.

Another way to determine larger distances is to take pictures with a telescope. 

This involves taking pictures of the same part of the sky at different times and then comparing the images. 

Knowing the distances to some of the celestial bodies, we can calculate the distances to others,
more distant ones, by seeing how they have moved in relation to each other and to the Earth. 
With the largest telescopes, astronomers have been able to see celestial bodies 10 billion light years away.

The Hubble Space Telescope is used for space research. Launched in 1990, it orbits 600 km above the Earth's surface.

This telescope in California, USA, was the largest in existence when it was built more than a century ago.
It is still used to study the universe.

The size of celestial bodies
It's thus difficult to understand the vast distances in the universe. 
Equally difficult is understanding how big the celestial bodies are. 
Is the Earth bigger than the Moon? How big is the Sun? How small is the Earth in the solar system?
Yes, the Moon is much smaller than the Earth. It would take 50 moon orbs to fill up the Earth. 
But the difference between the Earth and the Sun is much, much bigger than that. 
Because the sun is so far away, it looks small when you look up at the sky. 
But to fill up the Sun, you would need more than a million Earths!
