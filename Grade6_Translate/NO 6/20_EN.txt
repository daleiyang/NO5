Man discovers space

Humans have long dreamed of traveling through space and landing on the Moon or other celestial bodies. 
To leave Earth, you need to travel at very high speed. 
A spacecraft must be able to reach speeds of 40 000 km/h. 
In the past, the quest for new knowledge about space created fierce competition between countries.

Space travel

For years, there was a race between the United States and the then Soviet Union to be the first to send humans into space. 
This was after the Second World War, when tensions and uncertainty between these two countries were high. 
They were competing for the honor of being the most advanced in space research, but both also wanted to use spacecraft to spy on each other.

In 1957, the Soviet Union launched a satellite into Earth orbit. 
The satellite was called Sputnik 2 and on board was Laika the dog.
She became one of the first living creatures to travel into space. 
The satellite was not built to come back to Earth again, and Lajka died of heat and stress after a few hours.
Four years later, in 1961, the first space flight was made by a human being.
It was the Russian Yuri Gagarin who orbited the Earth. 
It took 108 minutes and he came back down safely.

Space traveler

Anyone who goes outside the atmosphere in a spacecraft is called a cosmonaut or astronaut. 
Both names are from the Greek. The word cosmonaut means 'sailor of the universe' and is used in Russia. 
In the United States, the term astronaut is used instead, 'star sailor'.

An astronaut or cosmonaut is trained in physics and engineering. 
He or she must also be in good health and fitness to be able to go into space.

In 2006, a Swedish person went into space for the first time. 
Astronaut Christer Fuglesang was sent up to the International Space Station (ISS). 
He spent a total of 26 days and 17 hours in space.
