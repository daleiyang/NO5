Extinct animals

At the end of the last ice age, around 10 000 years ago, the MAMMOTH lived in Europe. 
It was an elephant animal that was slightly smaller than modern elephants. 
Its thick fur enabled it to cope well with the cold climate. 
It is likely that humans hunted the mammoths so effectively that they died out.

On some islands to the east of Madagascar lived a large bird called the DRONT. 
It couldn't fly, but it survived until sailors discovered that they could eat it. 
It was easy to catch and kill. 
In 1681, the last dodo was killed.

The SABEL-TOOTH TIGER, with its enormous canines, must have been a feared adversary for early humans.
The upper jaw's canines stuck out of its mouth like two knives. 
One theory is that the tiger, with its mouth closed, cut the teeth of its prey and killed it.
