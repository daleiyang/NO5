Other metals.  
Most elements are metals.  
We use many different metals in our daily lives.  
There are metals in earrings, bicycles, pens, and zippers.  
You surely know more places.  
Some metals are heavy like lead, and others are light like aluminum.  
Aluminum.  
The most common metal in the Earth's crust is aluminum.  
It is a light metal extracted from the mineral bauxite.  
It is a mineral found in surface clay layers, unlike most other minerals found deep in the bedrock.  
In bauxite, aluminum is combined with oxygen.  
To extract the metal, the bauxite is melted and then a strong current is passed through the melt to remove the oxygen.  
Aluminum is one of the most used metals.  
Soda and beer cans are made of aluminum, and because it is light, it is used in cars, boats, and airplanes.  
It is also found in high-voltage lines because it conducts electricity well.  
Magnesium.  
Magnesium is dissolved in seawater and is the lightest of all metals.  
A cubic decimeter of magnesium weighs only 1.7 kg.  
Pure magnesium can burn with a strong white flame and can be used in flares and camera flashes.  
Magnesium alloys are used in cars to make them light.  
Zinc.  
Zinc is used to protect iron from rust.  
A thin layer of zinc is applied to, for example, nails, screws, tin cans, and fences.  
It is called galvanized iron.
