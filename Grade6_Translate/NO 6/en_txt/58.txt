Substances around us  
Where is carbon found in nature?  
Can one say that oil is a fossil?  
What is the difference between a rock and a mineral?  
What is an element?  
Do you know any important metals that we humans need?  
The ground you stand on is solid, cool, and steady.  
But beneath your feet flows a glowing mass.  
At the center of the Earth is the core, which is several thousand degrees hot.  
It is so hot that the substances there are liquid.  
But the Earth's crust is cold and hard.  
It can protrude as mountain peaks and rock slabs, but is often hidden under layers of soil or seas and lakes.  
In the Earth's crust, there are lots of substances that we humans want.  
We use them for cars, money, computers, jewelry, and in food.  
Do you know what substances they are?
