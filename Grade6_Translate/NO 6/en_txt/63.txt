The greenhouse effect  
The atmosphere creates a greenhouse effect that protects the Earth.  
But if we emit more carbon dioxide than plants can absorb, the effect is intensified.  
Then the climate becomes warmer: deserts expand, polar ice melts, and sea levels rise.  
Therefore, efforts are being made to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  
Consider?  
How do you think we could reduce carbon dioxide in the air while still getting energy?  
Human's part in the cycle  
Carbon is natural, it is found in almost everything we eat.  
When we burn food, carbon dioxide is formed, which we exhale, just like all animals.  
But we also cause carbon dioxide emissions in other ways.  
This happens when we extract and burn oil, gas, coal, and peat from the ground.  
These substances are called fossil fuels, and it has taken thousands or millions of years for them to form.  
We use them as fuel for cars, ships, and planes, and to get heat and electricity.  
When we burn the fuel, the carbon is released as carbon dioxide.  
The more such fuels we extract and use, the more fossil carbon becomes carbon dioxide in the air.  
Fossil fuels belong to what are called non-renewable energy sources,  
because it takes such a very long time for them to form.  
Another type of fuel is biofuel, biological fuel.  
This includes, for example, wood or chips from trees.  
Since there is carbon stored in the trees, we also release carbon dioxide when we burn biofuel.  
But biofuel is still considered a renewable energy source.  
This is because new trees are planted that can absorb carbon dioxide as they grow.
