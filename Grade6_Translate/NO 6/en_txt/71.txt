Titan
Titan is a very durable light metal.
It is not rejected by the body and can therefore be used, for example, when you need to pin together a complicated fracture or replace a hip joint.
Lead
You have probably heard the expression that something is as heavy as lead.
A cubic decimeter of lead weighs just over 11 kg. Lead is a harmful substance.
It has ended up in nature because people have used lead in gasoline, paint, and car batteries.
Since lead is toxic, efforts are being made to reduce its use.
Mercury
Mercury differs from other metals because it is liquid at room temperature.
Mercury was previously used in thermometers, but because it is toxic, it is no longer used.
Mercury has also been used in an alloy called amalgam to repair teeth.
Some energy-saving lamps contain mercury.
Since the metal is harmful, products containing mercury are collected, and efforts are also made to reduce its use.
Nickel
Nickel is a metal used in alloy with iron to produce stainless steel.
It is also found in other alloys, such as in jewelry, coins, and zippers.
Some people are allergic and can get eczema from nickel.
Recycling of metals
Ore resources are limited and can run out. To continue using metals, we must recycle what we have already used.
Much of the steel produced today comes from recycling.
Iron scrap is taken and melted down again.
Then you don't need to mine as much iron ore from the bedrock.
Moreover, it takes less energy to melt down scrap than to mine new ores.
Now that households are sorting out metal objects, even more can be recycled.
Moreover, it can be recycled over and over again.
To be able to recycle as much as possible, there is a deposit on some metal cans.
Titanium screws are used to attach artificial teeth to the jawbone.
In thermometers, a colored liquid is now used instead of mercury.
