Copper  
Copper has been used for a long time, just like iron, gold, and silver.  
It was discovered that copper formed when a certain type of stone was heated.  
That was how people learned to extract metal from ore.  
The ore that was first used contained chemical compounds of copper and carbon.  
When heated, the carbon combined with oxygen and disappeared into the air as carbon dioxide gas.  
What remained was pure copper. It could then be used for storage vessels, weapons, or tools.  
Copper alloys  
It was probably by chance that copper and tin were melted together.  
This resulted in an alloy called bronze.  
It turned out that bronze was an even stronger material than pure copper and better for making tools and weapons.  
4,000 years ago, bronze was so common that we now call that period the Bronze Age.  
Axes, swords, arrowheads, and shields were made of bronze.  
Then it became more common to make things from iron, and the Iron Age began.  
Another alloy with copper is brass, which consists of copper and zinc.  
Copper - a useful noble metal  
Copper does not rust and is not easily destroyed.  
Copper withstands both boiling and ice-cold water and is good for use in drinking water pipes.  
Copper also conducts electricity well and is therefore used for wires and cables.  
Copper can be recycled by melting down copper items and casting new objects.  
Brass can be used for, among other things, candlesticks and door handles.  
Roofs made of copper turn green over time.  
The green substance is called patina and is a compound with oxygen.  
The patina protects the copper so that it is not destroyed.  
So it does not become like when iron rusts and the rust destroys the iron.
