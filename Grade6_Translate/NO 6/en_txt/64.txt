Substances in the Earth's crust  
In nature, there are very few pure elements.  
Almost all are part of chemical compounds.  
The solid mass in the Earth's crust is called bedrock.  
In the bedrock, there are many different chemical compounds called rocks.  
Most contain oxygen, which is the most common element in the Earth's crust.  
Free oxygen is a gas that we breathe in and cannot see.  
But in the bedrock, oxygen atoms are bonded with other atoms and together they form substances we can see.  
Rocks  
The bedrock consists of different rocks, such as granite, gneiss, and limestone.  
A rock consists of minerals.  
Granite is a common rock that consists of many different minerals.  
Limestone is found in the bedrock of, among other places, Ã–land and Gotland.  
It has formed in warm seas and often contains fossils.  
Limestone consists of the mineral calcite, which contains carbon.  
Stones look different depending on which rock they are made of.  
Stones by water are often smooth because they have been polished by the water.
