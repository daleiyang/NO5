THEN AND NOW
When iron production began, iron ore was extracted from marshes and lake bottoms.
The ore was placed on glowing charcoal in a pit in the ground. Iron pieces were taken from the pit.
They were then shaped into various weapons, tools, and jewelry.
The first mines in Sweden began to be excavated during the Middle Ages.
It was in Bergslagen where there were mountains rich in metals.
A group of miners jointly operated a smelter where malleable iron was produced from ore from the mines.
At the end of the 19th century, iron production began on a larger scale.
Railways were built northward to large mines in Norrland.
Then a rapid development of the iron and steel industry began in Sweden.
Extracting metals from the rock
Extracting minerals or ores from the earth's crust is called mining.
When mining for ore on the surface, it is called open-pit mining.
When digging deep tunnels, it is called mining.
Mines have existed for several hundred years.
In the past, people hacked, dug, and used picks and fire to break the rock into smaller parts to extract what they wanted.
At the end of the 19th century, dynamite began to be used to blast the rock in the mines.
With the help of iron and forests, Sweden developed from a poor agrarian country to a rich industrial nation.
In iron ore, iron is combined with oxygen as two different minerals: black, magnetic magnetite and red hematite.
Most important in Sweden is magnetite. A chemical compound with oxygen is called an oxide, so magnetite is iron oxide.
In addition to oxygen, there are also other substances in the iron ore.
Several steps are required to extract pure iron from iron ore.
iron oxide + carbon -> iron + carbon dioxide
