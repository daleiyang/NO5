Atom means "indivisible" in Greek.  
It was because people believed that an atom was the smallest building block that existed.  
Today we know that it is not so.  
An atom consists of three types of particles. In the atomic nucleus, there are protons and neutrons.  
Around the nucleus, electrons orbit at an enormous speed. They move in different paths, called shells.  
But most of an atom is empty space.

Different substances  
The entire universe consists of different substances.  
Substances exist as elements or in various chemical compounds.  
All substances have different properties.  
They can be light or heavy, they can be liquid, solid, or gaseous.  
Some are soluble in water.  
They have different colors and can have a special smell. Some can conduct electricity.  
They can melt and boil at different temperatures. Some substances can be corrosive.  
Can you describe some substances around you?  
Atoms  
Everything is made up of atoms. An atom is so small that we cannot see it.  
There are about a hundred trillion atoms in a single tiny grain of sand.  
The atom has a nucleus made up of small particles, protons, and neutrons.  
Substances can have different numbers of particles in the nucleus, and that number determines what substance it is.  
Hydrogen is the smallest atom of all with only one particle in the nucleus.  
The carbon atom is much larger and has twelve particles in the nucleus.  
Around the nucleus, even smaller particles orbit.  
Elements  
An element is a substance where all atoms are of the same kind.  
The most common elements in the universe are hydrogen and helium.  
But there are more than a hundred different elements.  
Examples of elements:  
hydrogen oxygen carbon gold  
When several atoms are bonded together, it is called a molecule.
