The iron ore is enriched  
In the mine, the rock is crushed so that it is easier to sort out stones that are not wanted.  
Since magnetite is magnetic, a large magnet can be used to sort out the parts that contain magnetite.  
Stones that do not contain iron do not stick to the magnet.  
This is called ore enrichment.  
Blast furnaces sort  
To obtain pure iron, the oxygen, the oxide, must be removed.  
This takes place in large hot furnaces called blast furnaces.  
There, the magnetite is heated together with coal and limestone.  
The carbon then combines with the oxygen to form the gas carbon dioxide, which leaves the blast furnace.  
What remains is the metal iron, which is tapped from the blast furnace in molten form.  
By-products that do not contain iron are lumped together with the limestone and are called slag.  
The iron that has now been obtained is called pig iron and can be used to cast things.  
But often a harder and more malleable material is desired, which can be used to make cars, machines, and building materials.  
Then even more carbon is removed. This is called refining and transforms the iron into steel.  
Alloys  
There is a problem with iron.  
When it is exposed to humid air or rain, the iron reacts with the oxygen.  
Then rust forms and the iron disintegrates.  
To prevent rust, the iron can be mixed with other metals.  
It acts as a rust protection.  
When metals are mixed with each other or with other substances, it is called an alloy.  
Stainless steel is an alloy of iron and nickel or iron and chromium.
