Think?  
Why do you think the winner of a championship gets a gold medal while the runner-up gets silver?  
Noble metals  
Noble metals are rare and expensive.  
They are characterized by having more difficulty than other metals in forming chemical compounds with other substances.  
Examples of noble metals are gold, silver, and copper.  
Gold  
Gold is a noble metal. It does not form compounds with other substances.  
Thus, pure gold can be found in nature.  
Gold is not affected by weather and not even by strong acids.  
Pure gold is quite soft and easy to shape.  
To make it a bit harder, alloys are made with, among other things, copper or silver.  
Silver  
Silver is also a noble metal.  
It is used, among other things, for jewelry, bowls, and silverware.  
However, silver can be affected by other substances.  
If you eat eggs with a silver spoon, the spoon turns black.  
In the egg, there is sulfur that combines with silver to form a black substance.  
Then you have to polish the spoon to make it shiny again.  
Platinum  
Platinum is a silvery-white noble metal.  
It is rare and expensive and is used, among other things, in jewelry and for dental repairs.  
THEN AND NOW  
Gold and silver can be found as lumps in nature.  
They were discovered before other metals because they could be taken as they were,  
melted together into larger pieces and shaped into what was desired.  
This was done more than 10,000 years ago in countries that are now Iraq, Iran, and Egypt.  
In the deserts of Egypt, gold could be found.  
Tutankhamun was an Egyptian pharaoh who lived around 1300 B.C.  
When archaeologists excavated his tomb in 1922, they found that his coffin was made of pure gold,  
and the face was covered with a gold mask.
