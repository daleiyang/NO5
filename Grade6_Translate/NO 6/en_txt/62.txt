COAL is not always gray or black like in the pencil and charcoal,  
but can be transparent, shiny, and beautifully bright.  
Diamonds are also a form of carbon.  
The carbon cycle  
Carbon is an element that can bind to several other substances and form complex chemical compounds,  
which provide the conditions for life. Carbon is found in the sea, in the air, in the soil, and in all living things.  
When you exhale, you release carbon in gaseous form, carbon dioxide.  
Perhaps you have written with a pencil today? That is carbon, just like charcoal.  
Carbon travels in a cycle between the sea, air, soil, and through all living things.  
In the air  
In the atmosphere, carbon is in gaseous form, carbon dioxide.  
It is carbon and oxygen in a chemical compound, CO. Carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants.  
For the photosynthesis that occurs in green plants, carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight are required.  
In all plants, carbon is stored. In the fall, leaves and foliage wither and decompose.  
Then the carbon present there moves out into the air and into decomposers.  
In the sea  
There is carbon dioxide dissolved in the seawater.  
In fish, algae, and everything else that lives in the sea, there is carbon.  
It can be converted to gaseous form and rise into the air or be bound in algae and stored at the bottom.  
In the soil  
Everything that lives contains carbon.  
When an animal or plant dies and is broken down by decomposers, carbon dioxide is formed.  
But carbon can also be stored in the soil and serve as nutrients for plants.  
Stored carbon  
When carbon is stored deep in the ground for a very long time and under high pressure, coal, peat, gas, or oil is formed.  
Wood also contains stored carbon. It comes from the carbon dioxide in the air that the tree absorbed as it grew.  
This cycle is much shorter, as trees only live for about a hundred years.  
During a volcanic eruption, many different gases are released, including carbon dioxide.
