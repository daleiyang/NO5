Free fall

Italian scientist Galileo Galilei lived 400 years ago. 
He investigated how the speed of an object changed when it was allowed to fall freely. 
This movement is called free fall. It is said that he stood at the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and allowed various heavy objects to fall simultaneously. 
He came up with the astonishing result that all these objects also landed at the same time. 
Previously, it was thought that heavy objects fell faster than light ones.

Galileo also measured how fast a falling object accelerated. It turned out that the speed increases equally for every second it falls. 
This means that the acceleration of a free-falling object is the same all the time. This is called gravitational acceleration.

In many amusement parks there are rides called Free Fall. 
You go down at high speed, but it's not a free fall because you don't free fall.

The sailfish is probably the fastest fish in the world. It can swim at 110 km/h. 
That matches the fastest animal on land. 
The sailfish lives in tropical waters and uses its dorsal fin to herd schools of fish when hunting.

The cheetah runs short distances at speeds of 120 km/h. They are so fast at the start that they could outrun a racing car.
But cheetahs don't have much stamina and can only maintain this speed for about 500 meters.

The willow warbler is the fastest bird in the world. It can reach speeds of 320 km/h when it dives. 
This makes it the fastest animal

The PILGRIMSFALK is the fastest bird in the world. It can reach speeds of 320 km/h when it dives. 
That makes it the fastest animal of all. 
At this enormous speed, it dives down on its prey, which dies instantly from the impact.
