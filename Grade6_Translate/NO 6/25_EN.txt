The Earth is round

Nowadays, there is no need to doubt that the Earth is round like a sphere.
You can see it in photos of the Earth taken from space. 
But back in the 2nd century BC, the Greek scientist Eratosthenes realized that this was the case. 
He was even able to calculate that the distance around the Earth was about 37 000 km. 
That's pretty accurate, because the real circumference is about 40 000 km.

Eratosthenes was way ahead of his time. Traders and explorers traveling the seas in the 15th century also knew that the Earth was round, 
but it wasn't until the 16th century that most people began to accept the evidence.

Heliocentric worldview

In the 15th century, many scientists felt that there were flaws in the old way of explaining the world, that the Earth was at the center. 
The Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus made careful calculations of the movement of the planets. 
He believed that the sun was at the center, but most people did not take his ideas seriously. 
It was not until around 1600 that the German Johannes Kepler and the Italian Galileo Galilei were able to explain more clearly and convincingly.
more about the heliocentric worldview, that the sun is at the center. 
Helio means 'sun' in Greek. The Catholic Church did not like these ideas. 
For them, it was obvious that the Earth was at the center, anything else was unthinkable. 
Because the Church had so much power, no one dared to disagree, not even the scientists who had come to this conclusion.
In 1633, Galileo Galilei was brought before the court of the Catholic Church. 
He was forced to say that the Earth was stationary and did not revolve around the sun. 
It was not until 1992 that the Catholic Church apologized and said it had been wrong.

Space has inspired scientists throughout the ages. The picture shows a 16th century observatory with various tools and instruments used then.
