Think about it? which group do humans belong to?

Arthropods.   amphibians.      insects.    arachnids.    Crustaceans. Trilobites. 

Molluscs.  snails.     slugs.    Mussels. cephalopods. 

Ringworms.   Roundworms.  flatworms

Cnidarians.   sea anemones.  corals.     jellyfish.   

Mammals.  marsupials.  Placental animals.  Monotreme.

Monotremes are mammals of the order Monotremata. They are the only known group of living mammals that lay eggs, rather than bearing live young. The extant monotreme species are the platypus and the four species of echidnas.

reptiles.   birds.   dinosaurs.  

vertebrates.     Fishes.   bony fishes.  cartilaginous fish.  Jawless fishes.    Amphibians.  

echinoderms.   Sea cucumbers.  starfish.        Sea urchins

Cyanobacteria.   Single-celled primordial animal.   Cnidarians.   Invertebrates.         Sponges.     Fungi.   

The phylogenetic tree of the animal kingdom

One way to show how animals are divided into different groups is to draw it as a tree with many branches. 

First, animals with and without backbones are distinguished. 

Then you divide them into subgroups - the tree branches out. 

For example, let's look at the great crested newt and the crayfish. 

A vole has a backbone and is therefore a vertebrate in the group of birds. 

The crayfish has no backbone, it has its skeleton as a shell on the outside of its body.

To enable it to move, the shell is articulated. 

The group it belongs to is called arthropods.
