Movement and power

Can the moon pull the oceans on Earth?

Why do football boots have studs?

Do big rocks fall faster than small ones?

Why does the sledgehammer thrower spin around before throwing her sledgehammer?

WE ARE SO used to the way some things are, that we don't think about why that is. 
Like a stone thrown straight up in the air will soon come down again. 
But why does the stone fall down? Why doesn't it continue straight into space instead? 
If you're an ice skater, you've probably experienced that wonderful feeling of being able to glide for miles on the ice. 
But no matter how fast you go, you eventually stop. So why stop?
