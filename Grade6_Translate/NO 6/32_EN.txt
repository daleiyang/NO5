What is a force?

How do you make something move forward, stop or change direction? 
For that you need a force. Forces are always and everywhere. 
You could say that a force pulls or pushes something. 
For something to accelerate or decelerate, it needs to be affected by a force.
We can't see a force, but we can see the result of it.
Some forces can affect an object from a distance.

Gravitational force

The relationship between force and motion was discovered by an English scientist in the late 17th century. His name was Isaac Newton. 
It is said that Newton sat under an apple tree and wondered why apples fell to the ground. 
He didn't discover that everything falls to the ground, as that was already known. 
His important discovery was that the same kind of force that pulls the apple to the ground also keeps the celestial bodies in their orbits. 
We call this force gravitational attraction or gravity.

Gravity is crucial to our life on Earth.
It keeps us on Earth and ensures that an object we drop falls to the ground. 
Anything that weighs something is affected by gravity. The amount of force depends on how much something weighs.

Today we use Newton's name as the unit of force. 
If you weigh 48 kg, the Earth affects you with a gravitational force of about 480 Newtons, also written 480 N.

Isaac Newton wondered why the apples fell to the ground.

A force can also make something change shape.

Think about it

? How do you notice that forces are present when you drop something, when you play tennis or when you hit a boxing ball?
