A star lights up and goes out

NEBULOSES. Nebulae are large clouds of dust and gas found in galaxies. 
They form stars that can then shine for billions of years.
Five billion years ago, for example, our sun was formed from the solar nebula. 
So the Sun has been shining for five billion years and it is believed that it will continue to shine for about the same amount of time.

RED GIANT. When a star runs out of fuel, it swells up. Its temperature drops, turning it red.
The star becomes a red giant. When the fuel is almost gone, it contracts and forms a white dwarf instead. 
This will be the end of our sun.

Nebula. Star. Red giant. Planetary nebula. White dwarf.
Massive star. Red supergiant. Supernova. Black hole. Neutron star. 

BLACK HOLE. Really big stars end in collapse. The whole supernova contracts to a single point, a black hole.
No one can see a black hole and nothing can leave it. Not even light. 
The hole has a huge gravitational pull that attracts everything. 
Nowadays, we are pretty sure that there are black holes in the center of the Milky Way. 
This has been shown by observing how celestial bodies move nearby.

SUPERNOVA. Stars much larger than our Sun do not form red giants. 
Instead, when such a star runs out of fuel, it flares up into a red supergiant and explodes into a supernova. 
The outer parts are ejected into space, leaving a small compact body, a neutron star.
