The space above us

Throughout history, humans have looked up to the sky and been impressed by the diversity and beauty of the stars. 

Maybe you have experienced the same? When it's dark, you can see almost three thousand points of light in the sky. 

It's easy to let your imagination run wild and connect the stars into patterns and images.

Our ancestors did the same. The star groups became constellations that illustrated

people and animals in the tales told in ancient Greece more than two thousand years ago. 

Some constellations that got their names in this way are Hercules, Orion, the Great Bear and Little Bear. 

There are many different constellations, but which ones you see depends on where you are on Earth.

Some stars are more visible than others. This is because they shine brighter or are easier to find in the night sky. 

Throughout history, stars have helped people find their way around and find their way. 

The North Star, in particular, has helped many seafarers, as it is always visible due north.

The three stars in the center of Orion are called Orion's Belt.

The Pole Star. The Big Dipper is a group of stars that is part of the Big Dipper constellation. 

It is easy to find and recognize. You can always see the Big Dipper when it is clear and dark.

The Big Dipper

When you observe or photograph the night sky in the direction of the North Star for a long time, 

you can see that the whole sky seems to spin around it. But it is the Earth that is spinning.
