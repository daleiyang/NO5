The age of fish

Around 400 million years ago, the period known as the Age of Fishes began. 

This is when many different species of fish called cartilaginous fish evolved. 

Their skeletons were not made of bone but of cartilage, which is much softer. 

Some of the cartilaginous fish had no jaws. 

They fed by sucking on the bottom mud, which contained worms and small crustaceans. 

But there were also cartilaginous fish that did have jaws. 

One such was the nine-meter long armored shark. 

With a huge mouth and half-meter-long teeth, it could tear its prey apart.

Unlike today's sharks, it also had large bone plates to protect its head.

Other fish species during this time fed on plants, fish or crustaceans. 

All swam using fins and breathed with gills.

Some fish lived in tropical lakes that often dried up. 

These fish had lungs to breathe with.

There were also strange fish that had fins on shafts, like feet. 

On these shafts they crawled around on the bottom looking for food. 

Some of them could crawl up on land to get food. 

On land, there were already many plants and several animals, such as insects.

The two-tailed fish is also known as the tassel fin. It exists as a fossil and as a living fish.
