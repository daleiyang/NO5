Cells. The building blocks of life

The building blocks of all living things are cells. 

There are animal cells, plant cells and bacterial cells. 

Those made up of just one cell, like bacteria, are called unicellular. 

Those made up of more cells, like humans, are called multicellular.

Animals with shells

Cephalopods belong to the mollusc group of animals. 

Unlike the most common modern cephalopods, the first cephalopods had a tube-like shell. 

The largest ones could grow to two meters long and had eight arms. 

They swam around and hunted small animals, which they caught with their arms with suction cups. 

In case of danger, they could retreat into their shells which protected them from enemies.

Any animal with a hard shell could move freely in the water and forage during the day, when it was light. 

The shell protected them from many enemies. Animals without a shell could not forage during the day.

They risked being eaten.

Crustaceans are examples of animals that protect themselves with a shell even today. 

The shell becomes a problem when the animal grows. 

Then the shell becomes too tight and the animal has to break it and crawl out. 

The animal then has to wait for the skin to form a new and larger shell.

This fossil is called a trilobite. It is from an animal that lived in the sea 500 million years ago.
