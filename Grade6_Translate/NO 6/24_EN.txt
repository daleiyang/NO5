Discoveries that changed our worldview

Throughout history, humans have gazed into space. 
The moon, the sun and the stars arouse many fantasies, but also curiosity about our own place in all that is great. 
Today, we take it for granted that the Earth is round, that the Moon revolves around the Earth, 
and that both the Earth and the Moon revolve around the Sun. 
It is easy for us to be convinced of all this thanks to advanced instruments, both on Earth and in space. 
But this was not always the case.

Geocentric worldview

A worldview can be explained as people's perceptions of the place of the Earth in relation to everything else. 
Throughout history, humans have had several different worldviews.

As early as several thousand years ago, people noticed stars moving across the sky. 
The ancient Greeks called them wandering stars, but what they really saw were the planets of the solar system. 
The word planet means 'wanderer'.

It was believed that the planets, sun and moon revolved around the Earth and that the stars were stuck like a roof above it.
The Earth was believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th century. 
This view is called a geocentric worldview.

In Greek, the word geo means 'earth' and the word centric means 'center'.

The image shows the curious Renaissance man trying to look out into space, 
beyond the celestial sphere where the stars are stuck. 
He is looking for new ways to describe the world, because he has begun to realize that the old model does not fit.
