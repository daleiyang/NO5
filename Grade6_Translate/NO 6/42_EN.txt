The evolution of life

Time on Earth

Since the beginning of life on Earth, about 3.5 billion years ago, many different animals and plants have evolved. 

This has happened over a very long time. The time since life began has been divided into different periods. 

Each period has a name. The first period is the very longest period of time when the primordial cell existed and evolved.

Dinosaurs lived during several periods called the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. 

When you look at a timeline of life, you can see that it is a very short time that we humans have been on Earth.

Fossils tell the story

Traces and fossilized remains of animals and plants have been found that have been buried and preserved for a long time. 

These are called fossils. Fossil finds can be very old, sometimes several million years old. 

Fossils of dinosaurs, shells and plant parts have been found. 

Fossil finds are like pieces of a puzzle to understand how life evolved. 

To find out how old a find is, you can compare it to other finds from different times. 

This allows us to see how life has changed.

Studying and researching fossils also tells us more about how the climate has changed over time. 

How hot and cold the Earth is plays a major role in determining life. 

It is thanks to all the fossil discoveries that we know so much about the time before humans. 

And new fossils are being formed all the time. 

In several million years, the fossils formed today will be the traces of our time.

Traces of life can be found both in the bedrock and in amber. 

Amber is fossilized resin. The picture on the right shows an insect in amber.
