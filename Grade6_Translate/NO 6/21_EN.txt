Human footprints on the Moon

The first man to walk on the Moon was the American Neil Armstrong. 
The moon landing and the first moon walk took place in 1969 and was televised live around the world. 
When Armstrong set foot on the Moon, he famously said: "One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind".

The space race between the US and the Soviet Union eventually ended and today the countries cooperate instead.
They have linked their vehicles in space and built joint space stations. 
Since 2000, the International Space Station (ISS) has been orbiting the Earth. 
It is always manned and astronauts from around the world can conduct important research there.

Space research is moving forward all the time. 
We still dream of visiting other planets. 
To learn more, unmanned spacecraft, known as space probes, are being sent up. 
Several probes have been sent to Mars to study the planet's surface.

Of a rocket's total weight, the fuel is the largest part. 
When the fuel tanks are empty, they are released from the rocket in several stages.
