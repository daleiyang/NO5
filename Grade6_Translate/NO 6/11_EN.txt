Seasons

Think about it. We have seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres, but not at the equator. Why is this so? 

Every 24 hours, the Earth rotates one revolution around its own axis. 

During a year, the Earth also moves one revolution around the Sun. 

The Earth's axis is slightly tilted in relation to its orbit around the Sun; the Earth is slightly askew. 

It is this tilt that gives us seasons. In the part of the orbit where the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, it is summer for us. 

At the same time, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere. When the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, it is the other way around, and we have winter. 

The center of the globe is the equator. The further away from the equator you get, the greater the difference between the seasons.

The tilt gives us long and bright days in summer. 

In northern Sweden, north of the Arctic Circle, the sun is up 24 hours a day in the middle of summer. 

This is called the midnight sun. During the winter months, it is the other way around. 

For a period of time, the sun does not reach above the horizon even in the middle of the day. 

This 24-hour darkness is called midwinter darkness.
