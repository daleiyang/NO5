HAVE YOU THOUGHT about how small seeds can be?
Even though they are tiny, they can grow into something big.
First, a small root grows out from the seed and searches downward to take hold.
After a while, the stem will poke up.
A small first leaf unfolds, light green and completely new.
But the seed will not stop growing.
It will become a small plant and eventually perhaps a whole tree.
A hundred-year-old, strong, large tree was also once a small seed.
Just like you!
You have also been like a small seed.
Only when the egg and sperm met did you begin to grow and develop,
from a small embryo to a fetus and then to a child.
And you continue to grow.
Isn't it amazing that you actually exist!
