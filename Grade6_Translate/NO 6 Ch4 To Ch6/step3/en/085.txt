Bears in North America have discovered that salmon jump, and then they are easier to catch.
Finding food.
Sundew and butterwort are plants found in bogs.
They catch insects on their sticky leaves as an extra nutritional supplement.
Mosquitoes belong to the parasites, which live on their prey by taking nutrients from it.
The mosquito has a sharp tubular proboscis that it sticks into the victim's skin.
First, it injects a little liquid to prevent the blood from clotting.
Then it sucks in the blood.
Only the females suck blood.
The water strider is an insect that lives by small streams and lakes.
It manages to walk on the water's surface.
The water strider is a predator and eats other insects that have ended up in the water.
Just like the mosquito, it has a proboscis and sucks in nutrients.
Wading birds have both long legs and long beaks.
This makes it easy to find food in wetlands.
Other birds, like the dipper, dive and swim in running water to find food at the bottom.
The archerfish lives in rivers in the rainforests of Asia.
With its large eyes, it can determine the exact distance to an insect sitting on a leaf by the shore.
Therefore, it can aim accurately, spit out a jet of water and hit the insect so that it falls into the water.
In this way, the fish gets its food.
The beaver is a skilled rodent and can fell large trees.
With twigs, branches, and silt, it builds lodges and dams.
But a tree is not just building material but also food for the beaver.
In the fall, it gathers loads of twigs in the lodge's food storage.
It is food that should last all winter.
The beaver does not hibernate, but during snowy winters, it stays in its lodge.
The flamingo is one of the oldest bird species.
Fossils of flamingos that lived 10 million years ago have been found.
It has a clever way of filtering water through its beak to access the small organisms it feeds on.
