Coal is not always gray or black like in the pencil and the charcoal, but can be transparent, shiny, and beautiful.
Diamonds are also a form of carbon.
The carbon cycle.
Carbon is an element that can bind to several other substances and form complex chemical compounds, which provide conditions for life.
Carbon is found in the sea, in the air, in the ground, and in all living things.
When you exhale, you release carbon in gaseous form, carbon dioxide.
Perhaps you wrote with a pencil today?
It's carbon, just like barbecue charcoal.
Carbon travels in a cycle between sea, air, soil, and through all living things.
In the air.
In the atmosphere, carbon is in gaseous form, carbon dioxide.
It is carbon and oxygen in a chemical compound, CO2.
Carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants.
Photosynthesis that occurs in green plants requires carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight.
In all plants, carbon is stored.
In the fall, leaves and petals wither and decompose.
Then the carbon there is released into the air and to decomposers.
In the sea.
There is carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater.
In fish, algae, and everything else living in the sea, there is carbon.
It can be converted to gaseous form and rise into the air or bond in algae and be stored at the bottom.
In the ground.
Everything that lives contains carbon.
When an animal or plant dies and is broken down by decomposers, carbon dioxide is formed.
But carbon can also be stored in soil and be a nutrient for plants.
Stored carbon.
When carbon is stored deep in the ground for a long time under high pressure, coal, peat, gas, or oil is formed.
Wood also contains stored carbon.
It comes from carbon dioxide in the air that the tree absorbed as it grew.
This cycle is much shorter because trees only live about a hundred years.
During a volcanic eruption, many different gases are released, including carbon dioxide.
