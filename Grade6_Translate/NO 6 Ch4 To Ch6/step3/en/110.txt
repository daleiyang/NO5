A child is born.
Just like all other animals, humans have a strong drive to reproduce.
It is called the sex drive.
It is as natural as getting hungry or sleepy.
The sex drive is essential for the survival of the human species.
Human mating is called intercourse.
People do not have intercourse just to have children.
It can also be for pleasure and because it strengthens the love between two people.
During intercourse, the man's sperm is pumped from the testicles, through the seminal ducts and on through the penis.
In order for the sperm to enter the woman's uterus, the penis must become rigid so that it can be inserted into the vagina.
When the man is sexually aroused, the cavernous bodies of the penis fill with blood.
The penis becomes hard.
When the woman is sexually aroused, the mucous membranes become moist so the penis can more easily slide in.
The sperm swim into the uterus and up through the fallopian tubes.
If the sperm meet an egg, it can be fertilized by the first sperm to arrive.
Then the egg attaches itself to the uterine lining and starts to divide.
During intercourse between a man and a woman, the man inserts his penis into the woman's vagina.
