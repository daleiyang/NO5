Refined plants and bred animals
During the many thousands of years that we humans have practiced agriculture and hunting, we have also altered plants and animals to suit us.
We have strived to get a better yield from the harvest.
By saving the best seeds and sowing them the following year, and then sowing them year after year, we get crops that yield more.
This is called plant breeding.
Grains, potatoes, and apples are a few examples.
We have domesticated animals and livestock by breeding specimens with certain traits.
Wolves have become dogs and wild sheep have become woolly domestic sheep.
Our chickens originally come from the wild chickens of the rainforests.
Wood
In both coniferous forests, deciduous forests, and rainforests, there is wood that we humans need.
It can be, for example, for fuel, building materials, furniture, or papermaking.
In modern forestry, large areas are cut down and then new trees are planted.
In the new forest, all trees are the same age, which decreases diversity.
Clear-cutting in the rainforest can mean that torrential rains wash away the thin layer of soil, making it difficult for new vegetation to grow.
Power and electricity
In modern societies, electricity is needed.
To harness the power in flowing water, large hydroelectric power stations can be built.
It is a good and renewable energy source, but it affects life in the rivers.
Large dams are built and the water is conserved for certain periods, leaving the area below the power plant completely dry.
The wild ox has become various breeds of cows, some with a lot of milk and others with a lot of meat.
There are animals that also exploit human environments.
RATS gladly eat our food scraps and warm themselves in our houses.
CROWS are omnivores and very inventive when searching for food.
They exploit, for example, our garbage.
DOVES have found both nesting and feeding grounds in cities, where they look for food at outdoor cafes.
