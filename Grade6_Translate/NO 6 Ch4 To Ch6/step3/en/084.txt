Water environments.
Where the water is held back on its way to the sea, wetlands are formed.
They exist all over the world.
Wetlands can be bogs, fens, wetlands, swamps, and waterlogged coastal meadows.
In such areas, water is found right up to the ground surface.
In the wet soil layers of the wetlands, decomposition is so slow that peat forms.
Peat is partially decomposed plant parts that still contain nutrients and energy.
Water stays in wetlands, allowing plants to absorb nutrients carried by it.
It is a natural purification of water, which prevents eutrophication in the seas.
In streams, creeks, and rivers, there is also a lot of life.
If the water flows quickly, plants and animals need to find tricks to stay put.
It's easier in slow-moving waters.
Crocodiles lie hidden in rivers with only their nostrils and eyes above the water surface.
Then they can watch when some attractive prey comes down to the shore to drink water.
Adapt to the environment.
Various amphibians thrive in shallow waters.
They lay their eggs in the water, and the young live their first time there.
When they grow up, they are on land catching insects.
Birds that live here can wade in the wet areas because they have long legs, such as cranes, wood sandpipers, stilt sandpipers, and flamingos.
The salmon is a fish that lays its eggs in rivers but lives its adult life at sea.
To be able to get up in the rivers, it has strong muscles to swim upstream.
It can even jump up smaller waterfalls.
At the bottom of flowing waters, you can see small caddisfly larvae.
They are actually dragonfly larvae that build small "houses" of sand or sticks and fix them to the bottom.
Many small creatures live under stones to avoid being swept away by the current.
The caddisfly larvae hold on at the bottom.
