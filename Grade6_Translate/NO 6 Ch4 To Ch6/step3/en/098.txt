Nature must be protected
If we change a place or environment too much, it can affect everything that lives there.
We must ensure that many different types of nature remain.
There are rules for what can be done on certain lands.
New forest must be planted if logging is carried out, and old trees and protective groves around an eagle's nest must be saved, for example.
Another way to protect nature is for landowners to receive financial support to manage their lands in a certain way.
This can be creating an open landscape through grazing.
Endangered species can be protected by declaring them legally protected.
This means they cannot be harmed.
To preserve natural areas, nature reserves, bird sanctuaries or national parks can be created, with specific protection provisions.
The very first national park was Yellowstone in the USA, which was established in 1872.
Then the idea spread around the world.
All countries have their own laws and regulations for nature protection, but there are also those common to several countries.
Within the EU, protections have been created for particularly important nature, called Natura 2000 areas.
In the UN, countries have jointly decided to preserve and protect our biological diversity on earth.
Among other things, a protection called World Heritage has been implemented.
It can be given to both cultural and natural sites that are important to preserve for future generations.
Endangered species.
The orangutan is an endangered species that lives in the rainforests of Malaysia and Indonesia.
Deforestation has been extensive, and forests are even being burned down to obtain more farmland.
Areas of natural habitat for the orangutan have been reduced and therefore the species has declined in numbers.
Additionally, orangutans are threatened by illegal hunting.
The eel is a long, slender fish that can grow over a meter long.
Humans have fished eels for a long time.
Eels can live in both freshwater and saltwater.
Eels used to be abundant in the Baltic Sea, but today they are highly endangered.
Changes to rivers and streams through the construction of dams and hydroelectric power plants have destroyed the natural environment for the eel.
