Fertilization outside the body
Reproduction in most plants and animals requires a male and a female.
When two cells, a male cell, sperm, and a female cell, egg, fuse, new individuals with slightly different traits can be formed.
There is some variation in both traits and appearance.
Look at the siblings in a family.
They often resemble their parents and also have some similarities with each other, but there are also some differences.
In spring, you can see how pike spawn.
It means they gather to mate.
Several males closely follow the large female.
When the female is ready, she releases her roe, the eggs, into the water.
Over it, the males spray their milt, seminal fluid with male cells.
Pike's milk is made up of millions of sperm, each trying to find a grain of roe.
The sperm that first reaches an ovum fertilizes it.
Pike spawning is an example of external fertilization, as fertilization occurs outside the bodies of the pike.
The sperm swim with small tails and fertilization occurs in the water.
For the sperm and eggs to meet, the animals must produce large amounts of eggs and even more sperm.
The development of the fertilized eggs into fry occurs in the water, and the parents do not take care of either the eggs or the fry.
Frogs can live on land, but when it's time to mate, they go into the water.
Their fertilization takes place outside the body, in the water.
Here, the frog has laid its eggs in the water.
