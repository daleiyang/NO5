Copper.
Copper has been used for a long time, just like iron, gold, and silver.
It was discovered that copper formed when a certain type of rock was heated.
This is how people learned to extract metal from ore.
The ore first used contained chemical compounds of copper and coal.
When heated, the coal combined with oxygen and disappeared into the air as carbon dioxide gas.
What remained was pure copper.
It could then be used for storage vessels, weapons, or tools.
Copper alloys.
It was probably by chance that copper and tin were accidentally melted together.
This created an alloy called bronze.
It turned out that bronze was an even stronger material than pure copper and better for making tools and weapons.
4,000 years ago, bronze was so common that we now call that time the Bronze Age.
Axes, swords, arrowheads, and shields were made of bronze.
Then it became more common to make things from iron, and the Iron Age began.
Another alloy with copper is brass, which consists of copper and zinc.
Copper â€“ a useful noble metal.
Copper does not rust and is not easily damaged.
Copper withstands both boiling and ice-cold water and is good for use in pipes for drinking water.
Copper also conducts electric current well and is therefore used for wires and cables.
Copper can be recycled by melting down copper objects and casting new items.
Brass can be used for, among other things, candlesticks and door handles.
Roofs made of copper turn green over time.
The green substance is called verdigris and is a compound with oxygen.
The verdigris protects the copper from damage.
So it is not like when iron rusts and the rust destroys the iron.
