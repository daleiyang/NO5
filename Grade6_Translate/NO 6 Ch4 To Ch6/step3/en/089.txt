Termites of various kinds are of great importance to the savannah.
They are important decomposers of the tough grass.
Termites are insects that build communities, just like ants.
Because they have thin skin, they must protect themselves from the hot sun.
Some species live underground, while others build giant mounds of clay.
Different termites have different roles in the community: queen, king, workers, and soldiers.
Most are workers tasked with gathering food, building mounds, and feeding their king, queen, and larvae.
The soldiers are to defend the community against enemies.
The ostrich feeds on food it finds in the grass.
It can eat roots, seeds, insects, and lizards.
Because it forages with its head deep in the grass, it has difficulty detecting enemies such as lions.
But ostriches stay together in flocks, and there's always one keeping watch while the others eat.
When an enemy approaches, it's important to run fast, as ostriches cannot fly.
Lions cooperate when they hunt.
They gather in a small pack and try to outsmart their prey.
They can together single out an individual from a group, for example, an elephant calf.
A termite mound can be several meters high.
Lions often hunt in groups.
