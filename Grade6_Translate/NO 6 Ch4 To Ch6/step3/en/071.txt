Titan is a very durable light metal.
It is not rejected by the body and can therefore be used, for example, when a complex fracture needs to be pinned together or a hip joint replaced.
Titanium screws are used to attach artificial teeth to the jawbone.
Lead
You've probably heard the expression that something is as heavy as lead.
A cubic decimeter of lead weighs just over 11 kg.
Lead is a harmful substance.
It has ended up in nature because people have used lead in gasoline, paint, and car batteries.
Because lead is toxic, efforts are made to reduce its use.
Mercury
Mercury is different from other metals because it is liquid at room temperature.
Mercury used to be used in thermometers, but because it is toxic, it's no longer used.
Mercury has also been used in an alloy called amalgam to repair teeth.
Some low-energy bulbs contain mercury.
Since the metal is harmful, products with mercury are collected, and efforts are made to reduce its use.
Thermometers now use a colored liquid instead of mercury.
Nickel
Nickel is a metal used in alloy with iron to produce stainless steel.
It is also found in other alloys, such as in jewelry, coins, and zippers.
There are people who are allergic and may get eczema from nickel.
Recycling of metals
Ore resources are limited and can run out.
To continue using metals, we need to recycle what we have already used.
Much of the steel produced today comes from recycling.
Iron scrap is taken and melted down again.
Then there's no need to mine as much iron ore from the bedrock.
It also takes less energy to melt down scrap than to mine new ores.
Now that households are sorting out metal objects, even more can be recycled.
Moreover, it can be recycled again and again.
To be able to recycle as much as possible, a deposit is placed on some metal cans.
