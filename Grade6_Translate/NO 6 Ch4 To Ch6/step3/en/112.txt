Becoming an adult.
When girls and boys are somewhere between 10 and 16 years old, something exciting happens, puberty.
This means becoming sexually mature, meaning the body is mature enough to have children.
When puberty begins, it varies greatly between different people.
Often it happens earlier for girls than for boys.
A lot happens in the body during this period.
Now the child's body becomes more and more like an adult person's body.
Pimples.
When the body changes during puberty, hair and skin can also change.
The hormonal balance in the body changes, causing the sebaceous glands to produce more sebum.
It can make your hair and skin oilier and cause pimples, infections of the sebaceous glands.
Pimples are very common during puberty, some get few and others get more.
Pimples are most common on the face and upper body.
But they decrease or disappear completely as one gets older.
Another name for pimples is acne.
Voice change.
When boys enter puberty, the voice changes and becomes deeper.
This is called the voice change.
What happens is that the larynx and vocal cords grow.
During the voice change, the voice can sometimes switch between lighter and deeper tones.
Girls also experience the voice change, but it is not as noticeable.
Pimples are common in pubic hair.
Hair growth.
Another change in the body is hair growth.
More and thicker hair grows on arms and legs, under the arms and around the genitals.
Boys begin to grow facial hair.
The good thing about hair is that it provides protection.
Eyelashes and eyebrows protect the eyes from dirt.
