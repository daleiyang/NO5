Past and Present.
When people began producing iron, iron ore was taken from marshes and lake bottoms.
The ore was placed on glowing charcoal in a pit in the ground.
The pieces of iron were taken out of the pit.
These were then shaped into various weapons, tools, and jewelry.
The first mines in Sweden were excavated in the Middle Ages.
It was in Bergslagen where there were mountains rich in metals.
A group of miners together ran a smelter where malleable iron was made from ore from the mines.
In the late 1800s, iron began to be produced on a larger scale.
Railways were built around to large mines in Norrland.
Then began a rapid development of the iron and steel industry in Sweden.
Extracting metals from the mountain.
Extracting minerals or ores from the Earth's crust is called mining.
When digging for ore on the surface, it is called open-pit mining.
When digging deep tunnels, it is called mining.
Mines have existed for several hundred years.
In the past, people used picks, digging, and fire to break the mountain into smaller pieces to get what they wanted.
In the late 1800s, dynamite began to be used to blast the mountain in mines.
With the help of iron and forests, Sweden developed from a poor agricultural land to a rich industrial country.
In iron ore, the iron occurs combined with oxygen as two different minerals: black, magnetic magnetite, and red hematite.
Magnetite is the most important in Sweden.
A chemical compound with oxygen is called an oxide, so magnetite is iron oxide.
In addition to oxygen, there are also other substances in iron ore.
To extract pure iron from iron ore requires several steps.
Mine, iron oxide + carbon -> iron + carbon dioxide
