Finding food
Animals that eat grass thrive on the savanna.
There are large herds of various grazing animals, such as zebras, wildebeest, antelope, gazelle, buffalo, and rhinoceros.
Many of them are ruminants because grass is difficult to break down.
The grazing animals on the savanna eat grass at different heights, and each species gets its share.
Zebras and buffalo eat the grass when it is tall.
The wildebeests graze on mid-height grass, and different species of antelope eat the shortest grass.
When everything is heavily grazed, the warthogs come and dig up the grass roots.
Even the animals that eat leaves and twigs from the savanna trees have different levels.
The lowest branches are at the right height for rhinoceroses.
Elephants take leaves from higher up.
Giraffes reach the top leaves thanks to their long necks.
Grass fires regularly ravage Africaâ€™s savannas.
Here lives a very special bird called the secretary bird.
It has long legs with thick skin that can withstand the heat from the flames.
When the grass burns, small mammals, lizards, and insects flee.
When they swarm in large numbers to escape the flames, the secretary bird takes advantage.
Otherwise, it hunts by walking around in the grass and spotting its prey.
It kills its prey by stamping it to death.
Some antelopes can stand on their hind legs to reach higher.
