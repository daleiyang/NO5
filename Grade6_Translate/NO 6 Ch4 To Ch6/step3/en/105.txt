Reproduction with males and females
Many plants have flowers with both male reproductive organs, stamens, and female reproductive organs, pistils.
The stamens produce gametes, pollen, which should be transferred to the pistil.
In the pistil there are also gametes, egg cells, which form the seed after fertilization.
For pollen to reach the pistil, pollinators are needed.
These can, for example, be bees or butterflies.
The flower attracts them with nectar containing sugars and proteins.
By signaling with color or scent, the insects find their way.
When a bee crawls into the flower to suck nectar, the pollen of the flower sticks to the hairy bee and then follows it to the next flower.
Then the pollen sticks to the pistil of that flower.
The bee has pollinated the flower.
It's not only insects that pollinate.
Often it is the wind that helps the plant do this.
To reproduce safely, birch, spruce and various grasses, for example, have to waste pollen that is dispersed by the wind in large clouds.
This happens in spring, when many people experience allergic problems called pollen allergy or hay fever.
Fertilization
When a pollen grain has landed on the top part of the pistil, the stigma, pollination is complete.
Now the seed will form.
The pollen grain sends out a pollen tube that grows down through the flower's pistil.
Male gametes from the pollen grain travel down the tube and meet the flower's egg cell in the ovule.
The gamete that arrives first unites with the egg cell.
The flower is fertilized.
The ovule then develops into a seed that can germinate into a new plant.
Spruce pollen is spread by the wind.
