The Greenhouse Effect
The atmosphere creates a greenhouse effect that protects the Earth.
But if we release more carbon dioxide than the plants can absorb, the effect is amplified.
Then the climate becomes warmer: deserts spread, polar ice melts, and sea levels rise.
Thatâ€™s why efforts are being made to reduce carbon dioxide emissions now.
Consider
How do you think we could reduce the carbon dioxide in the air while still obtaining energy?
Human Role in the Cycle
Carbon is natural; it is present in almost everything we eat.
When we burn food, carbon dioxide forms, which we exhale, just like all animals.
But we also cause carbon dioxide emissions in other ways.
This happens when we extract and burn oil, gas, coal, and peat from the ground.
These substances are called fossil fuels, and it has taken thousands or millions of years for them to form.
We use them as fuel for cars, ships, and planes, and to produce heat and electricity.
When we burn the fuel, carbon is released as carbon dioxide.
The more of these fuels we extract and use, the more fossil carbon becomes carbon dioxide in the air.
Fossil fuels belong to what is called non-renewable energy sources, because they take such a long time to form.
Another type of fuel is biofuel, biological fuel.
This includes, for example, wood or chips from trees.
Since carbon is stored in the tree, carbon dioxide is also released when we burn biofuel.
But biofuel is still considered a renewable energy source.
This is because new trees are planted that can absorb carbon dioxide as they grow.

By using a lot of fossil fuels, we release more carbon dioxide than plants can absorb.
