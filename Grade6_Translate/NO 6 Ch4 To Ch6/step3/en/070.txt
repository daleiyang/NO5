Other metals
Most of the elements are metals.
We use many different metals in our everyday life.
There are metals in earrings, bicycles, pens, and zippers.
You surely know more places.
Some metals are heavy like lead and others are light like aluminum.
Aluminum
The most common metal in the earth's crust is aluminum.
It is a light metal that is extracted from the mineral bauxite.
It is a mineral found in shallow clay layers, unlike most other minerals which are found deeper in the bedrock.
In bauxite, aluminum is combined with oxygen.
To extract the metal, the bauxite is melted, and then a strong current is sent through the melt to remove the oxygen.
Aluminum is one of the most used metals.
Soda and beer cans are made of aluminum, and because it is light, it is used in cars, boats, and airplanes.
It is also used in high-voltage power lines because it can conduct electricity well.
Magnesium
Magnesium is dissolved in seawater and is the lightest of all metals.
A cubic decimeter of magnesium weighs only 1.7 kg.
Pure magnesium can burn with a strong white flame and can be used in flares and camera flashes.
Magnesium alloys are used in cars to make them light.
Zinc
Zinc is used to protect iron from rust.
A thin layer of zinc is applied to, for example, nails, screws, tin cans, and fences.
This is called galvanized iron.
