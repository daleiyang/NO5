Grass.
Grass tolerates grazing because, unlike the leaves of other plants, they grow all the way from the base.
This means that grass continues to grow even when it's grazed down.
Steppe and savanna.
In areas where heavy rain falls once or twice a year, vast grasslands spread out.
Between rainy seasons, a dry climate prevails.
Different types of grass can grow here, but for trees, it is harder to manage the transitions between rain and drought.
Additionally, there are often thunderstorms, and lightning can strike and cause grass fires.
Then the trees are destroyed, but the grass survives.
Grasslands have different names in different continents: pampas, campos, prairie, and the steppe.
The drier lands closest to the equator are usually called savannas, and those in colder climates are called steppes.
The steppes more often have thicker and more nutrient-rich soil layers.
Adapt to the environment.
The acacia and the baobab are two of the few trees that grow on the savanna.
They are extremely resistant to drought and highly resistant to fires.
When there is a severe drought, there is nothing for grazing animals, like elephants, to eat, and then they go on long migrations.
They travel in large herds.
The elephant has huge ears.
It's not just to hear other elephants from far away.
There is a dense network of blood vessels in their ears.
When the elephant flaps its ears, the blood cools down, and excess heat dissipates.
