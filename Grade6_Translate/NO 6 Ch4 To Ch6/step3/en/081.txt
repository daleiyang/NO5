Finding food.
Birds that stay in winter find food in the trees.
Bark beetle larvae live on wood and can be found in both live and dead tree trunks.
The woodpecker pecks holes in the trunk and inserts its long tongue to catch the larvae.
Tits, such as the goldcrest, willow tit, and crested tit, look for small insects in the crevices in the tree bark.
These birds can stay all year round because they eat both seeds and insects.
In the fall, they usually hide stores of seeds in bark crevices for the winter.
Squirrels eat seeds from cones and also collect a winter supply.
The marten is one of the predators in the coniferous forest.
It feeds on squirrels and small birds.
The moose changes its eating habits between seasons.
In summer, it eats leaves and green grass, but in winter, it eats twigs.
Snails live on the forest mushrooms.
The marten is a skilled climber.
Survive from enemies.
The hare has a clever way to trick its enemy, the fox, in winter.
The fox sees the hare's tracks in the snow.
But the hare turns and runs back a bit in its tracks, then takes a long leap to the side and runs in another direction.
This makes it difficult for the fox to understand where the hare ran.
The mountain hare is also white in winter.
A color for protection is called camouflage color.
Many larvae also have this - they look like bark flakes.
There are also animals that have a type of weapon to defend themselves.
The ants in an anthill spray acid on whoever attacks them.
Territory.
Many animals have territories, which means they want an area for themselves and their young.
They do not want others to take the food they need.
Foxes urinate on stumps, stones, and bushes around their territory.
Since foxes have a very good sense of smell, they know where the boundaries of other foxes' territories are.
Cooperate.
Tits that stay in winter usually spend the night close together on branches.
It is a good way to keep warm.
They also take turns sitting in the middle, where it is warmest.
Ants live in large colonies and have different tasks in cooperation.
Some collect needles and build the anthill, some take care of eggs and larvae, and others keep watch and defend the anthill.
Some male birds, such as capercaillie, show off, dance, fight and make loud noises to attract a female.
In clearings within the coniferous forest, one can see and hear such a capercaillie courtship display.
