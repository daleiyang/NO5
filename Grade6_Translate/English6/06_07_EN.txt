NO MORE HOLIDAYS


James   Hi, Jennifer. No more holidays.


Jennifer   Hello James. I know. It went so fast.


James   You're right. Did you go anywhere nice on holiday, then?


Jennifer   Well, I spent a month in Wales with my parents at my grandparents’ house.


James   In Wales? I’ve never been there. They say it’s beautiful.


Jennifer   Yes, the countryside is awesome, but it was raining the first week and there was a storm. 


The thunder and lightning was amazing, but it was a bit scary for our dog, Llanfair.


James   Did you see much of Wales then?


Jennifer   Well, we haven't got a car, so we rented mountain bikes in Afan Forest Park.


James   Cool! That's good for the environment.


Jennifer   Yes, you could choose between the 29-mile long Skyline Trail and a couple of rookie trails.


James   ... and you chose the rookie trails?


Jennifer   You bet. But there were lots of loose stones, tree roots and sharp turns.


James   Did it go well?


Jennifer   Well, the first time I tried the bike I fell off and sprained my right thumb.


James   Oh, no! Luckily you have a spare thumb on your left hand ...


Jennifer   Stupid! So what have you been up to this summer, James?
