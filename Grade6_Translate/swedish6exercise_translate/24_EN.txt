Parables and metaphors



Read the text and underline the similes and circle the metaphors.



Hello diary!



This weekend, my grandfather and I went on a trip with a difference.



We went to a commercial garden and took a horticulture course because Grandpa says I have green fingers.



The course was like Christmas Eve for me. 



I learned a lot and soaked up all the knowledge like a hungry bee. 



Grandpa was probably a bit bored. 



“I feel like a loser,” he said after accidentally digging up a precious bush. 



“I should have stayed home and dug in my memory instead.” 



I gave Grandpa a hug and told him he had a heart of gold.



Then he was happy as a lark again.



Choose one of the similes and write your own sentence that includes it. 



Choose one of the metaphors and write your own sentence including it.



In a simile, you compare one thing to another. 



The comparison uses the word 'like' or 'as':



You are like a rose.



Similes are part of figurative language and are used to create internal images in the reader.



Another imagery similar to the simile is the metaphor. 



In metaphor, the word 'like' is not used for comparison.



In metaphor, an expression is transferred from one context to another.



The word then takes on a different meaning: to have ice in the stomach.



Poetry and stories use similes and metaphors to create new images in the reader's mind:



Love is like cotton candy and ice cream.



You are my cotton candy, my ice cream.
