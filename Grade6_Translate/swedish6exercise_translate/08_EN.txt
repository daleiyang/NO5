Rocky the dog wins award



Rocky the dog, who saved a man from drowning in the river, receives Sjököpings-Posten's A true hero prize of SEK 10,000.



I am very happy, says the dachshund's mother Fia Gran. We celebrated yesterday with thin ribs. 



It is Rocky's favorite food.



The prize money will come in handy. 



Next week, Rocky will go on a dressage training course together with his master.



The goal is to compete in competitions and hopefully win.



The man, whom Rocky rescued, is doing well after the circumstances but says that he does not intend to jump in and swim in the river again.
