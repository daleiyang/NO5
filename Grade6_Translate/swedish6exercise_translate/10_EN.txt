Helpful students rewarded



The three students who helped an elderly lady find her way home last week were rewarded yesterday.



“We got a message that we were welcome at a party,” says 13-year-old Asmin.



It was the elderly woman, Beata Snöblad, who had invited the students home. 



She had prepared a dinner with a surprise for dessert. 



Beata said that unfortunately she had started to get confused lately and therefore got lost on her way home.



This has never happened before!



Now she wants to thank the children for what they have done and says that in future she will always take her phone with her when she goes out.



I can't count on getting help like that every time I get into trouble.
