Young people paid tribute to Gerd



The two fourteen-year-olds, who last week almost fell into a garage while sledding, paid tribute to their savior on Friday.



Vera and Hadi visited their savior, Gerd Fridh, 67, yesterday. 



They brought a box of jelly raspberries and a bouquet of twenty-five roses.



-“We're ashamed of what we did,” Hadi says embarrassed.



He is referring to the situation when they were going way too fast with the toboggan down the stalk road.



- “We took a chance and ended up crashing,” says Vera, whose jaw still hurts a bit after the accident.



Thank you for being so good with the stick and saving us, says Hadi.
 


Gerd Fridh, dressed in a fancy skirt for the occasion, doesn't want to talk about any heroics.



-“What generous children,” she replies, kissing both Hadi and Vera on the cheek.



Then she offers them Czech cookies and cherry juice.
