Dictatorship



Today, Sweden is a democracy, where all the people have a say. 



But it is only 200 years since the king had all the power in the country.



There are still countries where all important decisions are made by a single person, or a small group of people. 



These countries are called dictatorships. The person in power in a dictatorship is called a dictator.



Give me the clock ornaments The king needs them to pay off his old debts



Wing Yi's father escaped from dictatorial China



In 1989, thousands of young people gathered in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, the capital of China. 



With speeches and banners, they demonstrated against the country's dictatorship. 



The dictatorship met the youths' peaceful protests with violence. 



Tanks and troops stormed the square and several thousand people were killed. 



One person who was part of the carnage was Wing Li. He survived, but decided to flee. 



One night, he left his parents, siblings and home. 



I didn't want to live in a society where leaders murdered their people to stay in power. 



I was looking for a society where I can say what I think without fear of censorship and oppression. 



I was looking for a democratic country!



Wing Li managed to get to Sweden. Here he met Lena. 



Together they have a daughter Wing Yi.



“I wish my daughter could meet her grandmother, who still lives in China!” says Wing Li. 



But that's probably not possible as long as the dictatorship remains.



When Gustav Vasa seized the church bells in Sweden in the 16th century, he ruled like a dictator.
