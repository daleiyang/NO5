Democracy in practice



In a democracy, people make decisions through free votes and elections. 



This can be done in two different ways: through direct democracy or indirect democracy.



Direct democrAcy



One way of making democratic decisions is through referendums. 



This means that the whole population can go and vote on a particular issue.



Referendums are an example of direct democracy.



It is called that because the voters make the decision directly. 



So when you vote in class by a show of hands, or by handing in slips of paper, this is a form of direct democracy.



Direct democracy is best suited to decisions made by smaller groups such as a class, family or sports club.



Democracy comes from Greece



Democracy means people power or people rule. 



The word comes from Greece. More than 2,400 years ago, free men met in the square of their town. 



They discussed and voted on how the city should be run. 



Women, slaves, foreigners and children were not allowed to vote.
