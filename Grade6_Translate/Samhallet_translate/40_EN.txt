The government



The parties with a majority in Parliament have the power in their hands. 



They will win all votes and can therefore implement their proposals. 



One or more parties in the majority are therefore given a specific mandate by Parliament



to govern the country through a government.



Ministers sit in the government



It is the Parliament that decides who will be the Prime Minister (head of government). 



It is usually the leader of the largest party in the parliamentary majority who gets the job. 



The Prime Minister then decides which other ministers will work in the government.



Each minister is an expert in a particular field. 



There are usually around 20 ministers in the government.



The Minister of Finance oversees the government's finances.



The Minister for Social Affairs is responsible for health and social care.



The Minister of Justice is responsible for the police, courts and prisons.



The government makes proposals



Parliament always has many issues to deal with. 



One of the Government's tasks is to choose which issues Parliament should decide on first.



The government examines the issues carefully. 



When they have a proposal on what should be done, they submit it to the Parliament. 



In the Parliament, politicians from the different parties discuss the government's proposal. 



The Parliament then votes on whether or not to support the proposal.
