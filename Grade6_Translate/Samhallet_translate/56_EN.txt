Right and wrong



We have rules in the family, at school, at work, in traffic, at the swimming pool and many other places. 



Where do all these rules come from? And how do we decide what is right and wrong?



Laws and other rules



Laws are the most important rules in society. 



They apply everywhere and to all people. 



This is why laws are made by Parliament.



After all, it is the Riksdag that is responsible for dealing with issues that affect the whole of Sweden.



Other rules only apply in a particular place:



you probably have different rules in your families, 



and each school has its own specific rules. 



But family and school rules must never break the law!



Police and courts



Someone also has to enforce the laws.



It may also be necessary to punish those who break the laws.



In Sweden, it is the police who keep order in society and arrest criminals. 



Anyone who has committed a serious crime can be brought to justice in court.



The Bengtsson family decides its rules together. 



When they don't agree, it's mom and dad's word that counts.
