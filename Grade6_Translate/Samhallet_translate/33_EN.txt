The Swedish Parliament



Some issues affect the whole of Swedish society. 



For example, the roads that connect the country, 



and the military that defends our borders from north to south.



Roads, defense, prisons and other national issues are handled by politicians in the Swedish Parliament.



European Union (EU)



There are some issues that we cannot solve ourselves in Sweden. 



These issues require international cooperation, i.e. several countries working together.



Sweden and most other European countries work together in the European Union (EU). 



Politicians in the EU make decisions that all countries in the Union must follow.



It is not enough for just one country to work to save the environment. 



Emissions and toxins can so easily travel across borders by wind and water.



In the EU, politicians meet to try to solve environmental problems and many other issues that benefit from international cooperation.



who can do the most to bring peace - politicians in the local parliament or the EU?



National = applies to the whole country



The Parliament building is located in Stockholm.
