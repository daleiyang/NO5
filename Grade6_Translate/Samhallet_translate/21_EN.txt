Voters



People who vote on election day are called electors.



Only people of legal age can vote in elections. 



You become an adult at the age of 18.



At that age you are considered an adult and can make your own decisions about your life.



On election day 



The election takes place in special polling stations all over Sweden. 



Behind a screen, voters place a ballot paper from the party they want to vote for in an envelope. 



The voter then seals the envelope and hands it to an inspector. 



The envelope is placed in a box with all the other votes. 



The screen and envelope are used to preserve the secrecy of the ballot - anyone who wants to keep their vote secret should be allowed to do so. 



Where are the politicians?



In the elections, the people elect politicians to Parliament, municipalities and county councils. 



The politicians in the Riksdag decide for the whole country.



Politicians in municipalities and county councils govern our local communities. 



We will read more about the Riksdag, municipalities and county councils later on.



Why do you think there are political parties? Can't you influence society on your own?
