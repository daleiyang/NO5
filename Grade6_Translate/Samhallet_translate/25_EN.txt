Different ways to pay



Roads, schools and healthcare are things that most people need.



But they are also very expensive things to provide. 



Taxes can be a practical way of raising money from everyone in society.



After all, together we can afford it.



Another way for society to keep up with schools and hospitals is to let companies run them. 



The companies then get paid partly through tax money, 



and partly through fees from those who attend their schools or are treated in their hospitals.



A way to help each other



The tax is also used to reduce economic disparities between people.



Of course, those who earn little money can't pay as much tax. 



But they still have the right to education, healthcare and financial help. 



It works because people with higher incomes pay more tax. 



Their money is then used to help those who are less well off.



Here's how every £100 of tax is spent



Social services and benefits (help for the elderly, sick and unemployed) €42



Schools and education € 14



Health care and medical services € 14



Defense 3 kr



Business affairs 8 kr

Is it fair that some people pay more tax than others?
