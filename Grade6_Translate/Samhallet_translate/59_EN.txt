Habits and culture



Our habits play a big role in determining what feels right and wrong to do. 



Habits vary greatly between individuals and families. 



Some families like to eat in front of the TV, while others find it completely wrong.



If a large group of people have similar habits and traditions,



they are said to belong to the same culture. 



Cultural habits vary widely across the world, and they also change over time. 



In many countries, religion influences cultural habits. 



For example, a devout Muslim does not eat pork because it is against the commandments of the Koran.



Practical rules



Society is also full of rules, which exist to keep things practical and safe.



For example, we need rules in traffic to avoid crashing into each other. 



In Sweden, everyone drives on the right side of the road.



We have decided this so that traffic can function safely. 



The UK and other countries have left-hand traffic instead. 



Of course, this is not morally wrong. It's just another way of solving road safety.



Try to decide which of the rules on the previous spread are because of:



our morals



our habits



to make things work practically and safely



The Vikings sacrificed animals to the Aesir gods on Christmas Day. 



That would not feel right to us today. 



Our cultural habits have changed.



Now it's Donald Duck, the Christmas tree and Santa Claus for many. 



How would the Vikings feel about that? Hello?
