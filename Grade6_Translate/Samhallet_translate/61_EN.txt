Moral laws



The laws that underpin our morality have not changed much throughout history. 



For example, it has always been illegal to steal, murder and cheat others out of money.



Practical laws



Traffic rules, laws on how houses can be built and how the environment should be protected. 



These are examples of rules that exist to ensure that society functions in a practical and safe way. 



Such laws change quite often, as society evolves.



Technological developments often lead to the need for new laws. 



If there were brand new cars with jet engines, traffic rules would probably need to be changed to remain safe. 



If it turned out that jet fuel was harmful, new environmental laws would probably be needed too.



Why do we need special laws to protect children from unfair treatment?



The Romans ruled much of Europe 2000 years ago.



Here's what the Romans said: “These are the commandments of justice.



To live honestly. To do no harm.To let each man have his own.”



These main rules still apply in Swedish laws and in many other countries too.
