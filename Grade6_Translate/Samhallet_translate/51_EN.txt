The journalists' rulebook



People who work in television, radio and newspapers are called journalists. 



Journalists know that they have great power to influence what people think and feel. 



That's why they have agreed on certain rules:



News must be true and factual. 



They should tell what really happened, 



and journalists should not confuse their own opinions or feelings with the news itself.



If the journalist accuses someone of being wrong, that person must be given a chance to speak out, 



and give their own view on the matter.



Journalists should not spread unnecessary gossip about people's families, their finances or other private matters.



Photographs and other images should not be used to hurt people. 



If images are altered by computer, for example by blurring or adding details, 



the journalist should tell the readers and viewers.
