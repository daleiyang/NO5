Indirect democracy 



The school's student council is an example of how indirect democracy works. 



Each class votes for a student who then speaks on behalf of their classmates in the student council. 



Indirect democracy means that you lend your vote to a person you trust. 



This person then represents your will. 



This is why indirect democracy is also known as representative democracy. 



Referendums in Sweden



There have been several referendums in Sweden.



These have given the whole population the chance to say what they think about, for example



prohibition of alcohol (1922)



nuclear power (1980)



Swedish membership of the EU (1994)



whether Sweden should exchange the krona for the euro (2003)



I trust you.



You can borrow my vote. Use it to make wise decisions!



Indirect democracy can be a practical way of making decisions in society. 



It means that the whole population does not have to come together to vote every time something needs to be decided.



The politicians



In Sweden, most decisions are made through indirect democracy.



The Swedish people appoint their representatives through elections every four years. 



The representatives are called politicians. The politicians then make the decisions for the people.



It is a great trust to lend your vote to someone else. 



Another name for politician is therefore elected representative.



Is it really democratic that politicians decide so much for the rest of the people?
