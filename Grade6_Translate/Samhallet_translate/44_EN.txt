The European Union



Sweden and 26 other European countries work together in an organization called the European Union (EU).



Some of the EU's tasks



peace and security 



environment



trade



agriculture



Preventing criminals from moving between countries The EU was created in 1952. 



By then, Europe had been ravaged by war for several hundred years. 



The countries that formed the EU decided that people should be able to move more easily across borders within the Union. 



This would help people in European countries get to know each other better and do more business together. 



Increased trade and contacts between countries would reduce the risk of new wars. 



Enhanced cooperation



Peace and trade remain important tasks for the EU.



Some other big issues for the Union are: 



Environment: In the past, companies didn't have to think too much about what they put into the environment. 



Now, the EU has decided that all companies in the Union must pay for their toxic emissions. 



Companies that don't emit so many toxins can save money. 



And the environment is much better off!



To avoid having to exchange money, several EU countries have adopted a single currency.



Agriculture: Almost half of the EU's common money goes to agriculture. 



In the past, EU politicians were concerned that not enough food was being grown in Europe. 



So they spent a lot of money on agriculture.



Today, there is enough food. 



But without EU subsidies, many farmers would face financial problems.
