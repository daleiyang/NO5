Freedom of the press & freedom of expression



In Sweden, anyone is allowed to express their opinions through newspaper articles, books, films and radio.



This is part of freedom of the press and freedom of expression, which are two of Sweden's basic laws.



But we are not allowed to write or say just anything.



For example, it is illegal to write blatant lies about other people and to spread hateful messages against, for example, immigrants and homosexuals.



It is also forbidden to reveal secrets about the police or the military,



which could lead to Sweden being threatened by attacks from other countries, criminals or terrorists.
