Human rights



Human rights say that everyone in the world has equal dignity and the right to live in peace and freedom.



So whether you are rich or poor, young or old, dark or light should not matter!



Our rights



After two difficult world wars in the 20th century, the countries of the world came together to form the United Nations (UN). 



The countries of the UN wrote down a long list of rights, which apply equally to everyone on earth. 



Some examples of the rights that apply to all people in the world are



All people are born free and equal in value and rights



Everyone has the right to have a say in how the country they live in is run (including children!)



No one should be subjected to unjust punishment or torture



No one should have to starve, freeze or live on the streets



All children have the right to go to school, free of charge



Sweden has written UN rights into its constitution (see page 15). 



Politicians in the Riksdag must not create other laws that violate the constitution or threaten our rights.
