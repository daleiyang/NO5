Lövsta crime scene



Calm reigns over the small town of Lövsta, home to 16,000 people.



Police officers Stefan and Tomas are patrolling in their car. 



They know very well that something might happen soon - every year more than 2000 crimes are committed in Lövsta!



Micke is 22 years old and Robin is 17. They have been to a party.



- Come on Robin, let's get some cigarettes! says Micke.



It's not the first time he has committed a crime. 



Robin does not think, but just follows when they break into Lövstakiosken. 



It all feels exciting.



What they don't know is that watchful eyes see them from a distance ...



Stefan and Tomas act with lightning speed. Micke screams and waves his fists as they arrest him.



- “Just come with us to the police station,” says Stefan.



You are suspected of theft and vandalism!



Robin gets scared.



- Will I go to prison now? he has time to think before the door to the detention center slams shut.
