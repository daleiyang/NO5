But we have collected the money together! says Ida. 



So we should do something together, right?



Jocke joined the class only in fourth grade. He hasn't worked as much as the rest of us. 



He should be allowed to pay a little extra afterwards, actually! says Frida.



Jocke is not at school, but Rickard defends him:



“Frida, you know that Jocke has still done his best to help. 



Surely no one can do more than that? Rickard says.



“Besides, he's the one of us who needs the trip the most.



He's not having much fun at home right now!



Otto proposes a new vote.



In two steps! he says slyly. The class agrees to Otto's proposal.



First, the class votes on whether they should do anything at all together. 



There are 19 votes for, 5 against and 3 blanks.



No doubt - we'll do something! says Dogge victoriously. 



In his mind he is already on his way to Liseberg.



“Let's vote again, but only on the two most popular proposals,” says Otto. 



Then the mountain hike gets 14 votes and Liseberg 13. 



The proposal for mountain hiking thus gets a majority!



Suddenly even Plätten is happy.



But not everyone is so happy.



We had decided! say Dogge and Frida, who both want to go to Liseberg. 



Dogge is afraid of the wolverine and Frida hates hiking. They intend to stay at home!



Is it fair that Jocke gets to go, while Dogge and Frida stay at home? 



Would it be more democratic to go to Liseberg? 



Or should the money be divided up, so that everyone can decide for themselves?
