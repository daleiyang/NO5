HOW SWEDEN IS GOVERNED



To deal with all the big and small issues facing society, politicians in Sweden have to divide up their work. 



From local issues to those that affect the whole of Europe.



The municipalities



Sweden is divided into 290 municipalities. 



The people in each municipality appoint their own politicians. 



These politicians only work on issues that concern their municipality. 



The idea is that residents themselves should be able to shape their local community.



County councils and regions



Sweden's municipalities are divided into 16 county councils and 4 regions. 



The county councils and regions bring together several municipalities in the same area. 



The politicians in the county councils and regions decide, among other things, on healthcare. 



Healthcare is an issue that lends itself well to regional cooperation. 



It would be far too expensive if each municipality had its own hospital with its own doctors and medical equipment.



Region = area



Skåne, Halland, Gotland and Västra Götaland have regions instead of county councils. 



The regions handle a few more tasks than the regular county councils. 



If the inhabitants of Arjeplog municipality want to use their taxes to build a school, they turn to their local politicians.



Schools are a local issue that the people of Arjeplog can best decide for themselves. 



Region Skåne includes 33 municipalities. 



Politicians in the region decide on the 10 hospitals in Skåne. 



The region is also responsible for public transport, i.e. the buses and trains that run between the municipalities.
