Instead of prison



Being locked up with habitual criminals is not good care. 



In such an environment, it is difficult to get out of crime and drug addiction.



Other alternatives to prison are probation and community service. 



Probation means that the convicted person is allowed to live outside prison, but must maintain contact with a probation officer. 



The probation officer is there to help the offender improve his life and prevent him from committing new crimes.



Community service means that the convicted person has to do some work in the community without being paid.



Micke explains



-"I can actually understand why they sentenced me to prison.



It wasn't exactly the first time I broke the law.



In prison it wasn't great. There I only met bad people who tempted me to commit more crimes. 



A lot of people take drugs, so it's easy to start doing that too.



-- I told Robin: “Mind your own business! Stay out of jail!”



- Because I did well in prison, I got probation after a while.



My probation officer is helping me look for a job.



But who wants to give a job to an ex-offender?



Care or punishment? What do you think works best to reduce crime?



One in three prisoners released after serving their sentence is sentenced to a new prison term within three years. 



This means that many reoffend when they are released.



85 out of 100 crimes are committed by men.
