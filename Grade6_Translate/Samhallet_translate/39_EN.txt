State tasks



State means roughly the same as country or nation. 



The state tasks of the Riksdag include looking after the police, defense and the reception of refugees. 



These are things that should function in the same way throughout the country. 



They are also tasks that are too big and expensive for municipalities to handle on their own.



Legislation



Some of Parliament's decisions are written down in the form of new laws.



This is called legislation. The laws apply to all people throughout the country.



Municipalities and county councils must also comply with Parliament's decisions. 



Through legislation, the Riksdag ensures that schools and healthcare services function equally well throughout Sweden.



Compare the tasks of the municipalities and the state.
