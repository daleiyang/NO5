A NEW PLACE



Ida and her friends live in Lövsta. 



It's mostly asphalt, concrete, ugly houses and broken playgrounds with dog poop on the basketball courts. 



But Dogge has had a great idea:



- Let's get a more fun place to live. A community of our own! The best in the world!



They make a list of what should be in their new place:



Bathhouse



Playground with skate ramps, basketball court and big screen TV



Tree house to live in (with canned phones in between)



Kiosk with free sweets, food and movies



Road for parents and friends to visit



Rickard draws a map of their community. It will be in the forest behind Lövstaskolan. 



The map will be very nice! 



- But how will we get a bathhouse, ramps, food and everything else? Otto asks.



-- “We'll build everything together, of course!” says Dogge. 



And we'll have it together too.



- But I want my own house, Josse objects.



We can't have everything together! 



Or should we share toothbrushes and clothes too? 



And why can't we use cell phones instead of old cans? she sighs.



Dogge agrees that they can't have everything together. 



But he defends the canned phones:



- You can't call cheaper than that, Josse!



Otto continues with awkward questions:



- That free kiosk ... Where will the candy, food and movies come from? 



Will they rain down on Saturdays?



- Someone will have to work to get stuff for the kiosk, Ida suggests.
