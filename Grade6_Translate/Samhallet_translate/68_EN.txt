Young people and crime



Children under the age of 15 are not criminally responsible. 



This means they cannot be prosecuted in court.



Young people between the ages of 15 and 21 are not usually sentenced as harshly as adult criminals. 



Instead, they can get help from their local social services. 



Through talks, advice and various activities, the social services try to help the young offender get back on track.



Common crimes among young people



A survey showed that more than half of all young people in the ninth grade had committed a crime at least once. 



They might have stolen something on the bus, shoplifted a small item in a store or given a friend a lift on their bike. 



Such crimes rarely lead to any punishment.



The most serious crimes are committed by a small group of young people who are habitual criminals. 



Their homes often have problems with unemployment and drug abuse. 



Delinquent youths often hang out in gangs that commit crimes together.
