Reading



Heart and pain sound the same at the end.



Happened and joke sound almost the same at the end.



Poetic texts that rhyme



Some poetic texts rhyme. In this case, the lines end with words whose endings sound the same or almost the same.



1. Circle the words that rhyme (or almost rhyme) in the texts.



Draw arrows between the words that rhyme with each other.



2. Read these rhyming poetic texts with pen in hand.



Mark what catches your eye. 



These may be things that make you think or are difficult to understand.



In motion



The full day, it is never the greatest.



The best day is a day of thirst



There is a goal and meaning in our journey, but it is the way that is worth the effort.



The best destination is a night-long rest, where the fire is lit and the bread is broken in haste.



In places where you sleep only once,



sleep is safe and dreams are full of song.



Break up, break up! The new day is dawning.



Infinite is our great adventure.



Karin Boye
