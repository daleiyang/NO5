Poetry can make what's inside you shine



Poetic text



We all carry memories, feelings and experiences that we can turn into poems and poetic texts.



When you write poetic texts, you start from what is in your heart and in your thoughts, 



but also what is around you.



You can write poetry about the joy you feel when you pet a puppy, 



the sadness you feel when you fall out with your best friend, 



or the anger you feel about injustices in the world.



So poetry can be about big things and small things.



In this chapter, you will read and discuss different types of poetic texts.



You will discover how poetic texts can be structured and you will try your hand at writing poetry about something that is important to you.



And finally, you will read or sing your or someone else's poetic text to your peers.
