Welcome to Västbergaskolan and Blommensbergsskolan's production of Romeo and Juliet! 



Please do not take photos during the performance, as it disturbs the actors. Thank you very much!



The “actors”, that was us. ME. Now it was time.



I tried to remember my first line. 



But apparently my head had been broken into, and the thief had taken everything that had to do with lines.



Just as the panic was about to bubble over, it happened. 



Someone took my hand in the dark. 



I felt a warm breath right next to my ear, and a calm voice whispered:



Don't be nervous, you can do this.



Soft lips pressed against mine, and I got a kiss. 



A long, wonderful kiss that released all the tension and made my body feel like a freshly baked sponge cake. 



The next moment, the headlights came on, and I was blinded by a white flash of light. 



When my vision returned, I looked straight into a pair of eyes. Eris' eyes. ERIS!



A murmur was heard. I turned my head and realized that the curtain was gone. 



An entire theater full of parents, siblings, teachers and students stared at me with gaping mouths. 



Eris looked panicked and rushed for the exit.
