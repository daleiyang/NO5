Planning your writing - setting

In a horror story, setting is important.

Where do you think the bad thing will happen somewhere?

What does it look like where the bad thing happens?
How does it feel to be in the place?
Describe the place with as many adjectives as you can.
Use your senses when you write.

The toilet is no longer in use and it smells like a mixture of sewage and death. 
The sink is broken and the mirror has a big crack in it.
The light doesn't work and it's pitch black.
