Plan your writing - characters

In a horror story, it is someone or some people who experience the horror.

Who are the main characters in your horror story?
Describe them as accurately as you can. Fill in the mind map with supporting words.

Main character 1:
Outer personality traits
Inner personality traits
Other personality traits

Space for more mind maps:

When do they get scared for the first time?

Why is it that they are frightened?

What other people are involved?

I think there are two twelve-year-old twin sisters who are the main characters.
Now I just have to figure out how to describe them...
