Prepare a debate

Now you and some of your classmates will debate against each other.
But first, you and your group need to prepare carefully what you will say and how you will respond to your opponents' arguments.

What topic will you debate?

Who is on your team?

Who is on the opposing team?

Our thesis is:

What is your prior knowledge of the topic you are debating?

Where can you find facts about your topic?

Write down suggestions on where to look.

We are going to debate whether fireworks should be banned or not on New Year's Eve.
My team is for a ban!
