Prepare your opening statement
Debates start with a moderator introducing the two teams. 

Then one person from each team will give a short introductory speech. 
This should include an overall presentation of the topic and your thesis. 

1. Write an introduction statement to your debate topic. 
Use the checklist to make sure you include all the elements.

Checklist 
Our introductory speech includes:
a presentation of the group,
a presentation of the topic itself,
a thesis.

We are happy dog owners almost all year round.
But New Year's Eve is a nightmare day for us, as our poor dogs feel terrible about firecrackers.
Today we want to debate the merits or demerits of fireworks and of course we want to ban firecrackers forever.

Prepare your closing speech

A closing speech is addressed directly to the audience.

1. Write a conclusion summarizing the arguments you have put forward in the debate. 
Feel free to highlight the strongest argument you have and compare it to the opposing team's position.
You can also conclude with some kind of appeal.

Finally, we would like to reiterate that firecrackers should be banned, even if the other team argues that New Year fireworks are an important tradition for many.
We stand with our dogs on this issue.
Forward for stress-free dogs!
Away with dangerous firecrackers!
