Knocked Romeo, Curtain



RIDÅ



I have never liked theater. 



Not even when I was in kindergarten and we saw Pippi Longstocking at Midsommargården. 



I just couldn't concentrate on the plot. 



It was obvious from a distance that the actors were not children. 



The guy who played Tommy had stubble all over his face.



And when Mr. Nilsson hung upside down from the chandelier, a pack of cigarettes fell out of his pocket.



But worst of all was Little Old Man, Pippi's horse.



Of course, it wasn't a real horse, but two actors in a horse costume. 



One to do the head and one to do the butt. 



The actor who was the head had holes for his mouth and could breathe. 



But the butt apparently got no air at all. 



When they opened the costume after the performance, a little man fell out of the back. 



Red and sweaty with his hair licked along his head. 



The old man was completely finished and could not even bow after the applause, the other actors had to help him out of the stage.



As we left, I vowed never to set foot in a theater again.



Unfortunately, I had broken that promise.
