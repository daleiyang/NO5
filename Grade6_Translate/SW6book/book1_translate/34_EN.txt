Mom gently laid the sleeping Ali down on the floor where there wasn't a lot of stuff.



Maryam had also fallen asleep, and was carried away and put next to her brother.



“Let's clean up,” said mom.



Slowly they restored the room to its former state. Parvana's back and legs hurt. 



Mom was also moving slowly, all bent over.



Mom and Nooria put the things back in the cupboard. 



Parvana took the small broom down from the nail in the tyit room and swept up the spilled rice.



She wiped up the tea with a cloth. 



Their broken toshaker could be mended, but that would have to wait until tomorrow.



When the room looked somewhat normal again, the family, except for Dad, laid out quilts and blankets on the floor and went to bed.



Parvana couldn't fall asleep. She could hear her mother and Nooria tossing and turning too. 



She thought every little sound was either her father or the Taliban coming back.
