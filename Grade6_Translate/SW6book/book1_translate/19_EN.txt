The whole family had been out for a walk. 



This was before the Taliban came to power. 



Mom and Nooria wore only thin scarves around their hair.



Their faces soaked up the Kabul sunshine.



“It is the people who give the mountains their names,” Dad had said. 



“I am a human being, and I name that mountain Parvana.”



Mom gave in and started laughing. 



Dad laughed too, and Parvana and little Maryam who didn't even know why she was laughing. 



Even grumpy Nooria was laughing. 



The sound of the family's laughter spread quickly up Mount Parvana and back down to the street again.



Now Parvana and her father slowly made their way up the stairs. 



They lived on the third floor of an apartment building. 



It had been hit in a bombing raid and half the building had collapsed.



The stairs were on the outside of the house, zigzagging back and forth up the outside wall. 



They had been damaged by bombs, and here and there they were not connected. 



Only some parts of the stairs had a handrail. 



“Never trust the handrail,” Dad told Parvana over and over again. 



It was easier for Dad to go up than to go down, but it still took a long time.



Finally, they arrived at their own front door and went inside.
