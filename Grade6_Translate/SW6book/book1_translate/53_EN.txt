She held up ten fingers in the air - ten nan loaves. 



There was already a pile of ready-baked loaves, but she had to wait a little while for more loaves to be taken out of the oven.



The clerk wrapped the loaves in a piece of newspaper and handed them to Parvana. 



She paid without looking up.



The bread was still warm. It smelled so good! 



The wonderful smell reminded Parvana of how hungry she was. 



She could have eaten a whole loaf in one bite.



Next up was the fruit and vegetable stand.



Before she could choose what she wanted, a voice called out from behind her:



“What are you doing out in the street dressed like that?”



Parvana whirled around to see a Taliban standing there glaring at her with anger in his eyes and a stick in his hand.



“You must cover yourself! What is your father's name? Who is your husband? 



They're going to be punished for letting you go out on the street in those clothes!”



The soldier raised his arm and hit Parvana over the shoulder with the stick.



Parvana didn't even feel it. So they were going to punish her father?



“Stop hitting me!” she shouted.



The Taliban was so surprised that he stopped for a moment.
