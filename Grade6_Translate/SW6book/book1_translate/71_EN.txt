The next morning after breakfast, Parvana was back on the street.



“Take your father's writing utensils and his blanket and go to the market,” her mother told her. 



“Maybe you can earn some money. You've seen what Dad has been doing all along. Just do what he does.”



Parvana thought it was a good idea. Yesterday's shopping had gone well. 



If she could earn money, she might not have to do the housework at all.



The boy disguise had worked once. Why shouldn't it work again?



When she went to the market, her head felt light without the weight of her hair and chador. 



She felt the sun on her face, and a light breeze from the mountains made the air fresh and pleasant.



She carried her father's shoulder bag across her chest, which thumped against her legs. 



Inside were her father's pens and writing paper, and a few things she would try to sell, including her fine shalwar kamiz. 



Under her arm, Parvana carried the blanket she would sit on.
