Nooria smiled her superior big sister smile and tossed her hair. 



Parvana felt like kicking her.



Nooria had beautiful hair, long and thick. Parvana's hair was thin and streaky. 



She wanted to have hair as fine as her sister's, and Nooria knew it.



Parvana muttered to herself all the way down the stairs and along the block on her way to the neighborhood water tap. 



The way back with a full bucket was worse, especially the three flights of stairs. 



Anger at Nooria gave her the strength to make it, so Parvana kept muttering to herself.



“Nooria never goes to fetch water, and neither does mom. Neither does Maryam. She never has to do anything!”



Parvana knew what she was muttering was nonsense, but she continued anyway. 



Maryam was only five, and she couldn't carry an empty bucket down the stairs, let alone a full bucket up. 



Mom and Nooria had to wear burkas every time they went out, 



and they couldn't carry a bucket of water up those uneven, 



broken stairs with the burqa over their heads. 



It was also dangerous for women to go out unaccompanied by a man.



Parvana knew she had to fetch water because there was no one else in the family who could.



Sometimes this made her angry. Sometimes she was proud.



But she knew one thing - it didn't matter how she felt.
