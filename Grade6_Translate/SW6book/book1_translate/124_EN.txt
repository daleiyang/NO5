Sometimes the students came to Nooria, sometimes Nooria went to the students' homes. 



Sometimes Parvana went with her. 



Sometimes she carried Ali, who wriggled and squirmed.



“He's getting too big to be carried,” Nooria told Parvana during one of their lunchtime walks.



Mom had let Nooria leave Ali at home so she could get away from him for a while. 



They only had Maryam with them, and she was no trouble.



“How are your students doing?”



“They can't learn much in just a few hours a week,” Nooria replied. 



“And we have no books or school supplies. 



But I guess it's still better than nothing.”



The small gifts from the window continued to land on Parvana's blanket every few weeks. 



Sometimes it was a small embroidery. 



Sometimes it was a caramel or a single pearl.



It was as if the window woman wanted to say: “I'm still here”, in the only way she could. 



Parvana looked carefully around the blanket every time she went home, 



in case any presents had accidentally rolled away.



One afternoon she heard noises from above. 



A man was very angry. He was yelling loudly at a woman who was crying and screaming.
