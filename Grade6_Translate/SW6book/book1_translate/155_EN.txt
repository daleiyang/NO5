Parvana laughed.



“I'm coming,” she said. 



“Then we won't say goodbye. We'll just say we'll see you in a while.”



“See you,” said Shauzia.



Parvana hugged her friend one last time and then climbed onto the truck. 



They waved to each other as the truck drove away.



In twenty years, Parvana thought. What would happen in those twenty years? 



Would she still be in Afghanistan? 



Would there finally be peace in Afghanistan? 



Would she go back to school, get a job, get married?



The future stretched out unknown along the road in front of her. 



Her mother was somewhere up ahead, along with her sisters and their brother, 



but what else awaited her, Parvana had no idea. 



She was prepared for whatever it was. 



She found that she was even looking forward to it.



Parvana sat down next to her father in the truck. 



She put a dried apricot in her mouth and rolled the sweet fruit on her tongue. 



Through the dusty windshield, she could see the snow sparkling on the top of Mount Parvana.
