“Do you want to know a secret?” Shauzia asked.



She led Parvana over to a low wall where they sat down.



“I'm saving money, a little every day. I'm going to get out of here.”



“Where? When?”



Shauzia kicked the wall rhythmically, but Parvana made her stop. 



She had seen how a Taliban had beaten a child for drumming on an old plank. 



The Taliban hated music.



“I'll stay until spring,” said Shauzia. 



“By then I'll have saved up enough money and it's better to travel in spring than in winter.”



“Do you think we still have to be boys in spring? It's a long way off.”



“I want to stay a boy then too,” Shauzia insisted. 



“If I become a girl again, I'll have to stay home. 



I could never bear that.”



“Where will you go?”



“France. I'm going to get on a boat and go to France.”



“Why to France?” She asked.



Shauzia lit up.



“In every picture I've seen of France, the sun is shining,



people are happy and the flowers are blooming. 



French people must have bad days too, 



but I don't think their bad days are so bad, not like here.
