Mrs. Weera was going to Pakistan.



“Homa is coming with me. She can work there.”



They were going to contact members of the women's group that cared for Afghan women in exile.



“Where will you stay?”



“I have a cousin in one of the camps,” replied Mrs. Weera. 



“She has asked me to come and stay with her.”



“Is there a school there?”



“If not, we will start one. Life is completely different in Pakistan compared to Afghanistan. 



There is a lot of work to be done.”



Parvana had an idea.



“Bring Shauzia!”



“Shauzia?”



“She wants to leave. She hates living here. 



Can't she go with you? She could be your male companion!”



“Shauzia has her family here. Are you saying she's going to leave them? 



Drop out of the team just because the game is a bit tough right now?”



Parvana said nothing more. In a way, Mrs. Weera was right. 



That's what Shauzia was doing. But Shauzia was also right. 



Wasn't she right to try to make a better life for herself? 



Parvana couldn't decide who was more right.
