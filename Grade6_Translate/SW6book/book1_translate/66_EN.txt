It was a white skullcap covered with beautiful embroidery. 



She might never wear her beautiful red shalwar kamiz again, 



but she had a new cap instead.



“Here's some money,” said my mother. “Buy what you didn't get yesterday.” 



She put a pakul around Parvana's shoulders. 



It was Dad's. “Hurry back.



Parvana stuffed the money into the new pocket She put her feet in her sandals and reached for her chador.



'You won't need that anymore,' Nooria said.



Parvana had forgotten that. Suddenly she was afraid.



Everyone would be able to see her face! They would see that she was not a boy!



She turned around to plead with her mother.



“Don't make me do this!”



“See!” Nooria said in her meanest voice.



“I told you she was a coward.”



“It's easy to say someone else is scared when you're sitting safely at home in the meantime!”



Parvana blurted out.



She quickly turned and walked out, slamming the door behind her.



Out on the street, she waited for people to point at her and tell her she wasn't a real boy. 



But no one did. No one noticed her at all.
