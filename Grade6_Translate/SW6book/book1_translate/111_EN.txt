She's getting good at aiming, Parvana thought.



Two hits in a row.



This time the gift was a single red wooden bead.



Parvana rolled it between her fingers and wondered about the woman who had thrown it.



Now that her cemetery work was over, 



she had started going out again with Nooria and the toddlers in the middle of the day. 



Nooria had changed. 



She hadn't said anything mean to Parvana for ages.



Or maybe it's me who has changed, Parvana thought. 



It simply didn't make sense to argue with Nooria anymore.



In the afternoon she would meet Shauzia, 



and together they would walk around Kabul looking for customers. 



They didn't earn as much as in the cemetery, but they were doing well. 



Parvana had started to find her way around Kabul.



“There's a crowd over there,” 



Shauzia said one Friday afternoon, pointing to the sports stadium.



Thousands of people were making their way into the stands.



“Wonderful!” Parvana exclaimed. 



“People will want to smoke and chew gum while watching the football match. 



We will sell out of everything. Come on!”



They ran to the stadium entrance as fast as they could without dropping the cigarettes on the ground.
