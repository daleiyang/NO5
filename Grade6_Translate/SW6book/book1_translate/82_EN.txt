Parvana was too excited by the day's activities to sit still.



“I'll get you some water,” she offered.



“Are you volunteering to do something?” Nooria asked. 



“Are you really healthy?” Parvana ignored her.



“Mom, can I take Maryam to the water tap?” 



“Yes, yes, yes!” Maryam jumped up and down. “I want to go with Parvana!” Mom hesitated. 



“Let her go,” suggested Mrs. Weera. “Parvana is a boy now. 



Maryam is safe with her.”



Mom relented, but first she talked to Maryam. 



“What will you call Parvana when you are out?”



“Kasim.” 



“Good. And who is Kasim?”



“My cousin.”



“Very good. Now remember that, and do as Parvana says. Don't run away from her, promise?”



Maryam promised. She rushed off to put on her sandals.



“They're too small!” She started crying.



“She hasn't been outside for over a year,” Mom explained to Mrs. Weera.
