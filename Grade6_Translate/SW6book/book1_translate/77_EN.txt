Parvana tried to remember how her mother used to negotiate the price with the vendors at the market when she could go shopping.



She always used to bargain for the vendor's first price.



“They expect you to haggle,” she explained, ”so they start with a price so high that only a fool would pay it.”



Parvana thought quickly. 



She imagined her aunt in Mazar who must have worked hard to make all the embroidery on her dress and around her trouser legs. 



She thought of how beautiful she had felt wearing it, and how much she hated to get rid of it.



She said a price. The customer shook his head and made a counter offer, a much lower price. 



Parvana pointed out the fine details of the embroidery, and then said a price that was slightly lower than her first. 



The customer hesitated, but didn't walk away. After more back and forth negotiations, they agreed on a price.



It felt good to sell something, to have more money to put in the little pocket in the side seam of her shirt. 



It felt so good that she almost didn't feel sad when she saw the bright red fabric being carried away fluttering in the wind into the crowded market maze, never to be seen again.



Parvana sat on the blanket for a couple more hours, until she realized she had to go to the bathroom.
