It felt strange to be in the marketplace without Dad.



Parvana almost expected to see him in their usual place, 



sitting on the blanket, reading and writing letters to customers.



Women were not allowed to enter the shops. 



It was the men's job to do all the shopping, but if the women did shop, they had to stand outside and shout what they wanted. 



Parvana had seen shopkeepers beaten for serving women inside their shops.



Parvana wasn't sure whether she was considered a woman or not. 



On the one hand, she could get in trouble for not wearing a burqa if she stood outside the shop and shouted what she wanted. 



And on the other hand, she could get in trouble for not acting like a woman if she went into the store!



She put off the decision by buying some first.



The baker's stall had a window facing the street.



Parvana pulled her chador tighter around her face so that only her eyes were visible.
