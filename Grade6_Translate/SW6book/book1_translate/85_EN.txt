“That's the idea,” said mom.



“Then I could go out with you,” said Parvana. 



“I could bring Nooria too, so you could go out sometimes.”



Parvana was enthusiastic. 



Maybe if Nooria got some exercise, she wouldn't be so irritable.



Of course, she wouldn't get much fresh air under there, 



but at least it would be a change of pace for her.



“An excellent idea,” said Mrs. Weera.



“I don't want to go out with you,” Nooria said, but her mother stopped her from continuing.



“Nooria, Ali should go out. Parvana can handle Maryam by herself, but Ali is making so much trouble. 



You must keep an eye on him.”



“You should also make sure to come out sometimes, Fatana,” Mrs. Weera said to Mom.



Mom did not reply.



For Ali's sake, Nooria agreed to the proposal. 



Every day after lunch, Parvana, Nooria, Ali and Maryam went out for an hour. 



Ali had only been a few months old when the Taliban came. 



He really only knew the small room where they had been locked up for a year and a half. 



Nooria hadn't been out in all that time either.



They used to wander around the neighborhood until their legs got tired and then sit in the sun.
