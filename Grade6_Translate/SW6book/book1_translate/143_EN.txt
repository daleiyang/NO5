“I'm really glad you came,” said Mrs. Weera, nodding towards Parvana.



They went out onto the landing where Parvana couldn't hear them, and talked for a little while. 



Then they came back inside and after fetching some buckets of water, 



Shauzia sat down on the toshak next to Parvana.



She talked about the usual things for a while, how the sales had gone, 



people she'd met at the market, 



conversations she'd had with some of the tea boys and other boys who worked there. 



Finally, she said:



“It's no fun working alone. 



The market is not the same when you are not there. 



Please come back!”



When she said it like that, Parvana knew she couldn't say no. 



She had known all along that she had to get up sooner or later. 



She hadn't really intended to stay there on the toshak until she died. 



Part of her just wanted to disappear, 



but another part wanted to get up and live on and be Shauzia's friend. 



With a little persuasion from Shauzia, that other part won.



Parvana got out of bed and continued as before. 



She went to her work in the market, fetched water, 



listened to Mrs. Weera's stories and got to know Homa.
