She smiled and pretended to be brave. 



She knew it was too dark in the doorway for the woman to see her smile,

That helped, too, although it was hard to feel like a combat heroine with a cigarette holder around her neck.



The narrow, winding streets of the marketplace were completely different in the dark. 



Parvana heard their footsteps echoing in the narrow alleys. 



She wondered if she should ask the woman to walk a little more quietly because the Taliban had made it a crime for women to be heard walking, 



but she changed her mind. 



If the Taliban caught them outside during curfew and the woman had no burqa or anything else to cover her head, 



the sound of their footsteps would be the least of their problems. 



Parvana remembered the scenes in the stadium. 



She did not want to know what the Taliban would do to her or her companions.



Parvana caught sight of the headlights of an approaching car and pulled the woman into a doorway until the truck, which was full of soldiers, had disappeared down the street.
