Parvana was sure that the Taliban would let them return to school after a few days. 



By then, her teacher would have forgotten about the note to her mother.



“You are so stupid!” Nooria shouted at her."Leave me alone!”



One of the difficulties of living with the whole family in a single room was that it was impossible to leave anyone alone. 



Wherever Nooria went, Parvana was there too. And wherever Parvana went, Nooria was there.



Both of Parvana's parents came from old, respected Afghan families. 



Thanks to their education, they had earned high salaries. 



They had lived in a big house with a courtyard, a couple of servants, a television, a refrigerator, a car. 



Nooria had had her own room. Parvana had shared a room with her younger sister Maryam. 



Maryam talked quite a lot, but she thought Parvana was wonderful. 



It had been really nice to get away from Nooria sometimes.



The house had been destroyed by a bomb. The family had moved many times since then. 



Each time they moved to a smaller place. 



Each time their home was bombed, they lost more and more things. 



They became poorer with each bomb. Now they all lived together in one small room.



The war in Afghanistan had been going on for more than 20 years, twice as long as Parvana had been alive.
