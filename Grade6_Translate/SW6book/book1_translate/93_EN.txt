But first I need enough money to buy a tray and things to sell, 



but we never have any money left over.”



“Neither do we. Do you really think we could make more money that way?”



“If I believe what the other boys say, 



I'd make more than I do now, but what's the use of talking about it? 



Do you long to go back to school?”



The girls talked about their old classmates until they turned onto Parvana Street, 



the one with Mount Parvana in the distance. 



It was almost like the old days when Parvana and her friends used to walk home from school together, complaining about teachers and homework.



“I live up here,” said Parvana, pointing to the stairs outside the house. 



“You must come and see them all.”



Shauzia looked up at the sky to try to determine how late it was.



“Yes, I'll come in and say hello, but then I have to run home. 



When your mother tries to get me to stay for tea, 



you'll have to help me and tell her I can't.”



Parvana promised, and they went up the stairs.



Everyone was surprised when she came in with Shauzia. 



They hugged her as if she were an old friend, 



even though Parvana didn't think they had met before.
