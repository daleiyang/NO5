She found it hard to concentrate on the last two customers of the day and she was happy when she finally saw Shauzia come running up to the blanket.



“Where do you live?” Shauzia asked.



Parvana pointed.



“Let's pack up and talk as we go.



I brought these for you.”



She handed Parvana a small paper package with several dried apricots, 



something she hadn't eaten in ages. 



She counted them. There was one for each of them at home, 



and an extra one that she could eat herself right now. 



She bit into it and a wonderful sweetness filled her mouth.



“Thank you!”



She put the rest of the apricots in her pocket along with the day's ink and started packing up. 



There was no little gift on the blanket today. 



It didn't matter, Parvana thought. 



Meeting Shauzia was exciting enough!



“How long have you been doing this?” Shauzia asked as they walked from the market.



“Almost a month. How about you?”



“Six months. My brother went to Iran to find a job almost a year ago, 



and we haven't heard from him since. 



Dad died of a weak heart. So I had to start working.”



“My father was arrested.”
