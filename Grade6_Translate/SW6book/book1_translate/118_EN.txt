In one picture I saw a whole field full of purple flowers. 



That's where I want to go. 



I want to walk through that field and sit in the middle and not think about anything.”



Parvana tried to remember what her world map had looked like.



“I don't think you can get to France by boat.”



“Of course you can. I've figured out how to do it. 



I'll tell a group of nomads that I'm an orphan and I'll follow them into Pakistan.



Dad told me that they move back and forth according to the seasons to find grass for their sheep. 



In Pakistan, I go to the Arabian Sea, get on a boat and sail to France!” 



She said it as if nothing could be simpler. 



“The first boat I get on may not go straight to France, 



but at least I'll get out of here. 



Everything will be so much easier as long as I get out of here.”



“You're leaving alone?”



Parvana couldn't even imagine setting off on such a journey all alone. 



“Who will notice a little orphan boy?” Shauzia replied. 



“No one will care about me. I just hope I don't leave too late.”
