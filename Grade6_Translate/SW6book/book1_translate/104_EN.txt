“I kicked them away,” Parvana joked, but she was still shaking.



When Shauzia returned from her excursion inside the doorway, 



they knotted the blanket into a bundle after also putting down their skulls, 



and carried it away together to the bone merchant and his scales. 



He had to fill the bucket on the scales three times to weigh all their bones. 



He added up the total weight, said a sum and counted up the money.



Parvana and Shauzia didn't say anything until they were well away from the bone merchant's place. 



They were afraid he had made a mistake and given them too much.



“This is as much as I made in three days last week,” said Parvana.



“I told you we would make money!” Shauzia said, handing half of the money to Parvana. 



“Should we stop for today or keep digging?”



“Keep digging, of course.”



Mom was expecting her home for lunch, but she would think of something to blame.



In the middle of the afternoon, the clouds in the sky cleared. 



A stream of bright sunlight hit the cemetery.



Parvana nudged Shauzia lightly 



and they looked over at the mounds of dirt from the exhumed graves 



and at the sweaty and dirty boys next to the piles of bones glistening white in the sudden sunlight.
