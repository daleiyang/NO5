My mother was also on the ground and the soldier continued to hit her over the back with the cane.



Parvana quickly got to her feet.



“Stop it! Stop it right now! We are leaving now! We're leaving!”



She grabbed the arm of one of those who hit her mother. 



He shook her off as if she had been a fly. 



“Who do you think you are to tell me what to do?” But he actually lowered the cane.



“Get out of here!” he spat at Parvana and her mother.



Parvana bent down, grabbed her mother's arm and helped her up. 



Slowly, as her mother leaned on her for support, they stumbled away from the prison.
