Parvana put her feet in her sandals and wrapped the chador around her head. 



Then she followed her mother out the door.



Helping her mom down the broken stairs was a bit like helping her dad, 



because the billowing chador made it hard for her to see where she was putting her feet.



Mom stopped and hesitated at the foot of the stairs. Parvana thought she might have changed her mind.



But after a moment, she straightened her back and walked quickly into the street of Kabul.



Parvana rushed after her. She had to run to keep up with her mother's long,



fast steps, and she didn't dare fall behind. 



There were few other women on the street, but they all wore the regulation burqa,



which made them look the same. 



If Parvana lost sight of her mother, she was afraid she would never find her again.



Every now and then, Mom would stop in front of a man or a woman or a small group of men or even a young street vendor, 



and held out a photograph of Dad. She said nothing, just held up the photo.



Parvana held her breath every time mom did that.



Photographs were not allowed. 



Anyone she showed the photo to could turn Parvana and her mother in to the Taliban militia.
