The night was so dark that she could not distinguish the window from the wall. 



She kept an eye on it all night, until dawn finally pushed away the darkness and morning peeked through the window.



As soon as it was light, Mom, Nooria and Parvana stopped pretending to sleep. 



Quietly, so as not to wake the little ones, they got up and got dressed.



For breakfast they ate some leftover nan bread. 



Nooria was about to put tea water on the small gas stove in the washroom when her mother stopped her.



“There is boiled water left from last night. Let's drink it. 



We don't have time to wait for the tea to be ready. 



Parvana and I are going to bring Dad home from prison.”



She said it as if she had said, “Parvana and I are going to the market to buy peaches.”



Nan's bread fell out of Parvana's hand and onto the waxed cloth. But she didn't argue.



Maybe I'll finally see the inside of a prison, she thought.



The prison was far from home. Women who were not accompanied by a man were not allowed to ride the bus. 



They would have to walk all the way. But what if Dad was being held somewhere else? 



What if they were stopped by the Taliban in the street? 



Mom wasn't really allowed to leave home alone without male company, or without a note from her husband.
