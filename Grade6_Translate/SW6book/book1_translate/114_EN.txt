Keep your heads down, boys,” said a friendly voice above Parvana. 



“You'll see enough of this stuff when you grow up.” 



Their cigarettes and gum had fallen off the trays, 



but the men around them picked up the things they had dropped and returned them to the girls.



Parvana and Shauzia remained crouched between the men's feet 



and listened to the sword strike off six more arms.



“These men are thieves,” the soldiers shouted to the crowd. 



“You see how we punish thieves? We cut off one of their hands! Now watch!”



Parvana and Shauzia did not look. 



They kept their heads down until the kind man said:



"That's it for this week. Come, you can get up now.”



He and several other men stood around Parvana and Shauzia and followed them out of the stadium.



Just before she left, Parvana saw a young Taliban who had not yet grown a beard.



He was holding up a rope with four severed hands hanging like beads from a necklace. 



He laughed and showed off his prize to the crowd. 



Parvana hoped Shauzia didn't see it. 



“Go home now, boys,” the kind man told them. 



“Go home and remember better things.”
