Parvana put new groceries on the tray for the next day and then spread the tablecloth on the floor. 



Just as she had set out the dishes and teacups, Mrs. Weera came out of the washroom with their guest.



Dressed in her mother's clean clothes, with her hair washed and put up, the young woman looked less frightened, but more tired. 



She managed to drink half a cup of tea and eat a few bites of rice before falling asleep.



She was still asleep when Parvana left for work the next morning.



“Get us some water, please,” Mrs. Weera said to Parvana before she left for the market. 



“The poor girl's clothes need washing.”



Finally, after dinner that night, the girl could talk.



“My name is Homa,” she said. 



“I managed to get out of Mazar-i-Sharif just after the Taliban took the city.”



“The Taliban have taken power in Mazar?” Parvana exclaimed. 



“It can't be true! My mother is there. My brother and sisters are there.”



“The Taliban are in Mazar,” repeated Homa. 



“They went from house to house looking for enemies. 



They came to our house. They just walked right in! 



They took my father and my brother and brought them out. 



They shot them in the middle of the street. 



My mom started beating them and then they shot her too.
