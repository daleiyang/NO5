She put her feet in the tub of water, and that felt good too. 



She sat with her feet in the tub while Nooria prepared the evening meal.



“They couldn't say anything about Dad,” she told her sister. 



“What are we going to do? How are we going to find him?” 



Nooria started to say something, but Parvana couldn't make out what it was. 



Her head began to feel heavy, her eyelids drooped, and suddenly it was morning. 



Parvana heard breakfast being prepared.



I should get up and help, she thought, but she couldn't move. 



All night she had dreamed about the soldiers. They were shouting at her and beating her. 



In the dream, she shouted at them to let go of Daddy, but not a sound came from her mouth. 



She had even shouted: “I am Malali! I am Malali!” but the soldiers had paid no attention to her.



The worst part of the dream was watching my mother being beaten. 



It was as if Parvana saw it from very far away and could not move to help her get up again.



Parvana sat up suddenly, but then relaxed when she saw mom on the toshak across the room.



There was no danger. Mom was here.
