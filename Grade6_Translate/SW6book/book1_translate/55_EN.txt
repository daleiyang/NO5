“Dry your tears. In such circumstances it is very wise to run. 



I always thought you seemed like a wise girl, and you have just proved me right. 



Lucky for you! You've outrun the Taliban. Where are you going with all that bread?”



“Home. I'm almost there.”



“We'll join you. I'm going to check in with your mom. 



We need a newspaper, and your mom is just the person to take care of that.”



“My mom doesn't write anymore, and I don't think she wants to see anyone.”



“Nonsense. Come on, let's go.”



Mrs. Weera had been a member of the Afghan Women's Association with her mother. 



She was so sure that Mom wouldn't mind her visiting that Parvana obediently led the way.



“And stop breaking the bread! They won't try to jump out of your arms!”



When they had almost reached the top step, Parvana turned to Mrs. Weera.



“It's about mom. She's not feeling very well.”



“Well, it's a good thing I'm stopping by to check on her!”



Parvana gave up. They arrived at the apartment door and went inside.



At first Nooria only saw Parvana. She took the nan-bread from her.
