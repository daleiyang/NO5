“No, thanks,” said Parvana. 



“Throw it away.” Mom pursed her lips.



“You just sulk,” she said, dropping her hair to the floor. 



As her hair fell to the floor, Parvana began to feel like a new person. 



You could see her whole face. 



What was left of her hair was short and tousled. 



It curled softly around her ears.



There were no long strands to fall into her eyes, 



tangle when it was windy outside or take ages to dry when she got caught in the rain.



The forehead seemed bigger. 



Her eyes seemed bigger, too, perhaps because she squinted them open so she could see everything that was going on. 



The ears seemed to stand straight out from the head. 



They look a bit funny, Parvana thought, but funny in a nice way. 



I have a nice face, she decided.



Mom ruffled her hair to get rid of all the loose strands.



“Change your clothes,” she said. Then she walked out of the washroom.



When she was alone, Parvana reached up and felt her hair. 



At first she touched it gently, but then she rubbed her palm all over her head. 



The new hair felt both rough and soft. 



It tickled her palm.



I like it, she thought and smiled.
