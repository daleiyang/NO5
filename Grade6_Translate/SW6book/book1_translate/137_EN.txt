“Good. I think we should sit near the door. 



That way we can find our way out into the street without having to light a match. 



I don't want to draw any attention to ourselves.”



Parvana slowly pulled the woman to her feet.



Carefully they walked over and sat down just inside the doorway, 



still hidden from those who passed by outside. 



They waited in silence for nightfall.



Kabul was a dark city at night. There had been a curfew for more than twenty years. 



Many of the streetlights had been ripped apart by bombs and those still standing were not working.



“Kabul was the entertainment center of Central Asia,” Parvana's mother and father had told her many times.



“We used to take a walk along the streets at midnight and eat ice cream. 



Earlier in the evening, we would go to bookstores and record shops. 



It was a city with a lot going on, it was exciting and full of light.”



Parvana couldn't even imagine what it had looked like then.



Soon it would be as dark as it could get.



“Stay close to me,” Parvana said, even though she didn't need to. 



The woman held her hand tightly.



“It's not far to walk, but I don't know how long it will take tonight. Don't worry.”
