“But you haven't even met him!” Parvana shouted at Nooria the next day at lunchtime.



It was the first time they could discuss the matter alone.



“Of course I've met him. Our families were neighbors for many years.”



“But that was when he was a little boy. And I thought you wanted to stay in school!”



“I will,” said Nooria. 



“Didn't you hear a word my mom said last night? 



I'm moving to Mazar-i-Sharif in the north. 



The Taliban are not in power in that part of Afghanistan. 



Girls can still go to school there. 



Both his parents are well educated. 



I can finish school, and they will even send me to the university in Mazar.”



All this was written in a letter that had arrived while Parvana was out working. 



The women in the groom's family were in the same women's group as my mother. 



The letter had been passed between the members of the group until it finally arrived.
