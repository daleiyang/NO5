Parvana saw him hesitate and started to run. 



She knocked over a bunch of turnips in the vegetable stand so that they rolled all over the street.



She pressed the still-warm nan-bread to her chest and kept running, her sandals clacking against the street. 



She didn't care that people were staring after her. 



She just wanted to get as far away from the soldier as possible, as far as her legs would carry her. 



She was so eager to get home that she ran straight into a woman carrying a small child.



“Is that Parvana?” 



Parvana tried to get away, but the woman grabbed her arm firmly.



“It's Parvana! What kind of way is that to carry bread?”



The voice inside the jar sounded familiar, but Parvana couldn't remember who it belonged to. 



“Say something, little girl! Don't just stand there gaping like a fish out of water! Say something!”



“Mrs. Weera?”



“Yes, of course, my face is covered. 



Then you can't see who it is. I forget so easily.



But why are you running and why are you breaking the nice bread?”



Parvana started to cry.



“The Taliban ... one of the soldiers ... he was chasing me”
