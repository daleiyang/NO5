The men left. 



Parvana wanted to go back to her father, but Mrs. Weera stopped her.



“Let him rest now. There will be plenty of time to talk tomorrow.”



Parvana obeyed, but Mrs. Weera had to take care of him for several days before he started to get better.



Most of the time he was too sick and tired to even talk. He coughed a lot.



“That prison must have been cold and damp,” said Mrs. Weera.



Parvana helped her boil broth and then spoon-fed Dad until he could sit up and eat by himself.



“Now you are both my daughter and my son.” 



Dad said when he had recovered enough to notice her new appearance. 



He ruffled her short-cropped hair and smiled.



Parvana made many trips to the water tap.



Dad had been badly beaten, 



and the poultices Mrs. Weera used to dress his wounds had to be changed and washed often. 



Homa also helped out, 



mostly by keeping Mrs. Weera's granddaughter calm so that Daddy could rest.



Parvana didn't mind that he couldn't talk right away. 



Just having him home made her overjoyed. 



She spent her days earning money and her evenings helping Mrs. Weera.



When Dad was feeling better, she would read to him from her books.
