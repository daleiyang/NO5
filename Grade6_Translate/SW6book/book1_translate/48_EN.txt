her feet still hurt, but she played with Ali and Maryam. 



The two toddlers, especially Ali, couldn't understand why mom didn't care about them. 



“Mommy is sleeping,” Parvana said over and over again.



“When will she wake up?” Maryam asked.



Parvana did not answer. 



Ali kept pacing to the door and pointing at it. 



“I think he's asking where Daddy is,” said Nooria.



“Come here, Ali, and we'll find your ball.”



Parvana remembered the torn photograph and took out the pieces. 



Her father's face was like a puzzle.



She laid the pieces out in front of her on the carpet. 



Maryam sat with her and helped her put them in the right order.



One piece was missing. Dad's whole face was there, except for a piece of his chin. 



“We'll tape it up when we get some tape,” said Parvana.



Maryam nodded. She gathered the small pieces into a neat pile and handed them to Parvana.



Parvana tucked them away in a corner of the cupboard.



The third day passed very slowly. 



Parvana even thought about doing some housework just to pass the time, but she was afraid of disturbing her mother.
