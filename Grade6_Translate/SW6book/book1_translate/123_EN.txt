Now that the mountain passes were passable, traders came to Kabul from all over Afghanistan. 



From her blanket in the marketplace and as she walked around selling cigarettes with Shauzia, 



Parvana saw people from different tribes in Bamian, 



from the Rigestan desert region near Kandahar and from the Wakhan Pass near China.



Sometimes these men would stop and buy dried fruit and cigarettes from her. 



Sometimes they would ask her to write something for them. 



She would always ask where they came from and what it was like to live there, 



so she would have something new to tell her family when she got home. 



Sometimes they would tell her about the weather.



Sometimes they told her about the beautiful mountains or the fields of opium poppies about to bloom, 



or the orchards bursting with fruit. 



Sometimes they told her about the war, about battles they had seen and people they had lost. 



Parvana memorized everything so that she could recount it to her family when she got home.



With the help of her mother and Mrs. Weera's women's group, they had started a small school. 



Nooria was a teacher. The Taliban closed down any school they found,



so Nooria and Mrs. Weera were very careful. 



There were only five girls in this school, including Maryam. 



They were all about her age. 



They were taught in two different groups, never at the same time on two consecutive days.
