She had learned some English at school, and one day when Parvana came home from work, 



she heard Homa and her father speaking English to each other.



Homa stuttered a lot, but the words flowed from her father's mouth in a steady stream.



“Did you bring another educated woman home today?” Dad asked Parvana, smiling.



“No, Dad,” replied Parvana. “I just brought some onions.”



For some reason, everyone thought it was funny,



and it was great to hear laughter in the house.



One thing in her life had become good again. Dad was home now. 



Maybe the rest of the family would come home soon too.



Parvana was hopeful. At the market, she chased after customers just like the real boys. 



Mrs. Weera thought Dad would get better faster with the help of medicine, 



so Parvana worked and worked until she managed to earn enough money to buy it. 



The medicine seemed to help.



“I feel like I'm working for a goal now,” she told Shauzia one day as they walked around looking for customers. 



“I'm working to get my family back.”
