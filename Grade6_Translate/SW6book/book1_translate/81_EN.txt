It was in the basement of a collapsed house.



“We are the last of the Weera family,” she said. 



“The bombs took some, the war and pneumonia took the rest.”



Parvana didn't know what to say. Mrs. Weera didn't sound like she wanted to be comforted.



“We've got to borrow a karachi this afternoon,” Mrs. Weera said. 



“The owner needs it back tonight so he can take it to work. 



But we can do this in one go, can't we?”



Mrs. Weera had also lost many things in the bombings.



“What the bombs didn't take, the looters did.



Easier to move then, isn't it?”



Parvana loaded some patchwork quilts and kitchen things onto the karachi. 



Mrs. Weera had already packed everything.



“Here's one thing they didn't take.” She pulled a medal with a colorful ribbon out of a box. 



“I won this in a sports competition. It shows that I was the fastest woman in Afghanistan!”



The sun shone on the gold of the medal.



“I have other medals too,” said Mrs. Weera.



Some I have lost, but some I still have.” 



She sighed slightly, but then collected herself.



“Break's over! Back to work!”



By the end of the afternoon, Mrs. Weera had moved in and the karachi had been returned.
