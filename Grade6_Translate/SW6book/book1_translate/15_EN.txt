First, the Soviet Union rolled its big tanks into the country and brought in planes and dropped bombs.



Parvana was born a month before the Soviet soldiers began to retreat to their own country.



“You were such an ugly baby that the Soviet soldiers couldn't bear to be in the same country as you,” Nooria used to tell her. 



“They fled in terror back across the border as soon as their tanks could roll.”



After the Soviet soldiers left, those who had fired on the Soviet army decided they wanted to continue fighting, so they fired on each other.



There were many bombs falling on Kabul at this time. Many people died.



All Parvana's life, bombs had been falling. 



Every day, every night, rockets fell from the sky and made someone's house explode.



People ran when the bombs fell. 



First they ran one way, then they ran the other to find a place where the bombs would not find them. 



When she was younger, Parvana was carried. When she grew up, she was allowed to run on her own.



Now the Taliban controlled most of the country. The word “Taliban” meant scribe, 



but Parvana's father told her that religious scriptures were there to teach her how to be a better person; 



how to be kinder to others. ”
