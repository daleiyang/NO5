Shauzia and I want to buy trays and things to sell. 



That way I can go to places where there are lots of people, 



instead of sitting and waiting for customers to come to me. 



I can make more money.”



“We do well on what you earn from reading letters.”



“No, Mom, we don't,” Nooria said. 



Mom quickly turned to lecture Nooria for contradicting her, but Nooria continued.



“We have nothing left to sell. 



What Parvana earns is enough for nan, rice and tea, but we have nothing left.



We need money for rent, for gas, for lamp fuel. 



If she can make more money digging up graves and is willing to do it, 



I think she should have it.”



Now it was Parvana's turn to be surprised. 



Was Nooria taking her side? Such a thing had never happened before.



“I'm glad your father isn't here to hear how you answer me!”



“That's just it,” Mrs. Weera said quietly. 



“Their father is not here. Everything is not as it used to be. 



So ordinary people have to do extraordinary things just to survive.”



Finally, Mom relented.



“You have to tell me everything that happens,” she told Parvana. 



“We'll write about it in the newspaper so that everyone knows what's going on.”
