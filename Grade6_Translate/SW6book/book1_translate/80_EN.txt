Parvana was in too good a mood to care.



After they had tea and nan for lunch, Parvana went with Mrs. Weera to collect her belongings. 



Mrs. Weera was wearing her burqa, of course, 



but the way she walked was so special that Parvana was sure she would be able to recognize her among all the other women in burqas in the market. 



She walked as if she were rounding up children who had lingered after a lesson at school. 



She walked quickly, head held high, shoulders back. But Parvana stayed close to her for safety.



“The Taliban don't usually go after women who are out alone with small children,” 



said Mrs. Weera, “but you can never be sure. 



Luckily, I can probably outrun any one of those soldiers. 



I've dealt with a lot of teenage boys in my years as a teacher. 



After a good lecture, not one of them has been able to hold back the tears!”



“This morning I saw a Taliban crying,” said Parvana,



but the words vanished into thin air as they walked quickly through the city streets.



Mrs. Weera had been living with her grandson in a room even smaller than Parvana's family's.
