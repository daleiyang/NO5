But everyone looked at the photo and then shook their heads. 



Many people had been arrested. Many people had disappeared. 



They knew what mom was asking for without her having to say anything. 



Pul-i-Charkhi prison was a long walk from Parvana's home. 



When the huge fortress finally came into view, her legs hurt,



her feet ached and worst of all - she was terrified.



The prison was dark and ugly, and it made Parvana feel even smaller.



Malali shouldn't have been afraid, Parvana knew that. 



Malali would have gathered an army and led them in storming the prison. 



Malali would have been delighted by such a challenge. 



She wouldn't have been shaky in the knees like Parvana.



If Parvana's mother was scared, she didn't show it. 



She marched straight to the prison gates and said to the guard:



“I have come to get my husband.” The guard paid no attention to her. 



“I've come to get my husband!” Mom said again.



She took out Dad's photograph and held it up in front of one of the guards.



“He was arrested last night. He hasn't committed any crime, and I want him released!” 



More guards arrived. Parvana tugged lightly on her mother's burka. 



Mom paid no attention to her.
