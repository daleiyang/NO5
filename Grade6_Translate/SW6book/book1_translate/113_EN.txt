“Let's get out of here,“ said Shauzia, 



”Nobody is buying anything from us and I don't know why, but I'm getting scared.”



“We'll leave as soon as the match starts,” said Parvana. 



“If we try to leave now, people will stare at us.”



More men came onto the pitch, but they were not footballers. 



Many men were brought in with their hands tied behind their backs. 



A table that seemed heavy was carried out by two soldiers.



“I think those men are prisoners,” Shauzia whispered.



“What do prisoners have to do with a football match?” Parvana whispered back.



Shauzia shrugged.



The ropes were loosened on one of the men and he had to bend over the table. 



Several soldiers held him down with their arms stretched across the table top.



Parvana had no idea what was happening. 



Where were the footballers?



Suddenly, one of the soldiers took out a sword, 



raised it above his head and cut off one of his arms.



Blood splattered in all directions. The man screamed in pain.



Next to Parvana, Shauzia started screaming. 



Parvana put her hand tightly over Shauzia's mouth and pulled her down to the floor of the stands. 



The rest of the stadium was silent. No one had started cheering yet.
