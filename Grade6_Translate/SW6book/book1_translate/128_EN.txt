“And since you are still a child, you are coming with us.”



“I'm not going,” Parvana insisted. 



She even stamped her foot on the floor.



“Now you'll do as you're told,” said Mom.



“All that running up and down the streets has gone to your head.”



“I'm not going to Mazar!” Parvana repeated, stamping the floor again.



“Since your feet are so eager to move, you'd better take them for a walk,” said Mrs. Weera. 



“You can get some water at the same time.”

Your aunt won't tell anyone, of course, 



but we can't count on everyone else to be as careful.
