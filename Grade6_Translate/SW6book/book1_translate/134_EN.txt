The sound was far too low and far too sad to be scary.



“Hello?” Parvana called out, not too loud.



It was too dark to see where the woman was sitting. 



Parvana fumbled around among the things on the tray until she found one of the matchboxes. 



She lit a match and the flame flared up. 



She held the burning match in front of her and looked for the crying woman.



It took three matches before she spotted the figure huddled against the wall. 



She continued to light matches so she could see as she walked towards the woman.



“What is your name?” Parvana asked. The woman continued to cry. 



“Then I will tell you my name. My name is Parvana. 



I should say my name is Kasim, because I pretend to be a boy. 



I am dressed as a boy so that I can earn money, 



but really I'm a girl. So now you know my secret.”
