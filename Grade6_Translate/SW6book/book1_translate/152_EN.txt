Anything that was different was seen as entertainment.



“The flowers won't grow in that soil,” someone said. 



“It's far too nutrient-poor.”



“Even if they grow, they'll get trampled.”




“The marketplace is no place for flowers.



Why would you plant them there?”



Through the mocking voices, another was heard.



“Don't any of you like nature? 



This boy has made an effort and brought some beauty to our gray marketplace, 



but do you thank him for it? Do you help him?” 



An old man pushed his way to the front of the assembled crowd. 



With difficulty, he crouched down to help Parvana plant the flowers. 



“Afghans love beautiful things,” he said, 



“but we have seen so much ugliness that we sometimes forget how beautiful something as simple as a flower can be.”



He asked one of the tea boys who was nearby to fetch some water from the tea pot. 



The water came and he poured it around the flowers so that the soil was soaked.



The plants looked a bit droopy. They were drooping.



“Are they dead?” Parvana asked.



“No, not dead. Now they may look withered and scraggly,” he said, ”but the roots are healthy. 



When the time comes, the roots will support healthy and strong plants.”
