But they were still entertaining, 



and Mrs. Weera was always so positive that her enthusiasm rubbed off on the others. 



No one told Parvana when she ran out of bread,



but she still went to work that day. 



Some things you just had to do.



“I'm glad you're back,” 



Shauzia said when she saw Parvana in the market.



“I've missed you. Where have you been?”



“I didn't feel like working,” Parvana replied.



“I wanted a few days of peace and quiet.” 



“I wouldn't mind that either, 



but it's messier at our place than out here.” 



“Do they still fight with each other in your family?”



Shauzia nodded.



“Grandma and Grandpa never liked my mom. 



Now they depend on her. It makes them cranky. 



Mom is cranky because we have to live with them because we have nowhere else to go. 



So everyone is grumpy. 



When they're not arguing, they sit around and stare at each other.”



Parvana thought about how it used to feel at her house sometimes, when everyone walked around with their mouths agape 



and tears that never came out. 



It seemed to be even worse at Shauzia's house.
