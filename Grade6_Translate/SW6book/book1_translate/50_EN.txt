The room also started to smell bad.



“We have to save water,” Nooria said, so they didn't wash or clean. 



Ali's dirty diapers had accumulated in a pile in the washroom. 



The small window could not be opened very much. 



No wind could blow into the room and bring the stench back out.



On the fourth day, the food ran out.



“We have no food left,” Nooria said to Parvana.



“Don't tell me. Tell your mom. 



She is the adult. She has to get more for us.” 



“I don't want to bother her.” 



“Then I'll tell her.” 



Parvana walked over to mom's toshak and shook her gently. 



“We've run out of food.” She got no answer. 



“Mom, there's no food left.”



Mom pulled away. Parvana started shaking her again. 



“Leave her alone!” Nooria jerked her away. 



“Can't you see she's depressed?”



“We're all depressed,” Parvana replied. 



“We're hungry too.”



She wanted to scream out loud, but didn't want to scare the toddlers. 



But she could stare, so she and Nooria stared at each other for hours.



No one ate anything that day.
