She chose the same place where she and Dad used to sit. 



It was by a wall. On the other side of the wall was a house. 



The wall hid most of the house. 



There was a window above the wall, but it had been painted black in accordance with Taliban orders.



“If we sit in the same place every day, people will know we are here, 



and they will think of us when they need something read or written,” Dad used to say. 



Parvana liked it when he said “we”, as if she was working with him. 



The place was also close to their home. 



There were busier places in the market, but it took longer to get there, 



and Parvana wasn't sure if she could find it.



“If anyone asks who you are, tell them you're my father's nephew Kasim,” said my mother. 



They had gone through the whole thing over and over again, until Parvana knew it by heart. 



“Say that Dad is sick, and that you're staying with the family until he's well again.”



It was safer to say that Dad was sick than to say that he had been arrested. 



No one wanted to be seen as an enemy of those in power.



“Will someone pay me to read to them?” Parvana asked. 



“I'm only eleven.” 



“Even so, you have a better education than most people in Afghanistan,” said Mom. 



“But if no one asks you to read to them, we'll have to figure something else out.”
