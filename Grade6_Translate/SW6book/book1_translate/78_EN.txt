There was nowhere she could go at the market, so she had to pack up her things and go home. 



She did almost everything the same way she did when she was with her dad - put her things in her shoulder bag, 



shaking the sand out of the blanket. It made her long for Dad. 



“Daddy, come back!” she whispered, looking up at the sky.



The sun was shining. How could the sun shine when her father was in prison?



Something caught her eye, a quick movement.



She thought it was coming from the black painted window, but how could it be possible? 



Parvana decided that she had only imagined it. 



She folded the blanket and tucked it under her arm. 



She felt that the money she had earned was safely tucked away in her pocket. 



She was very proud of herself and ran all the way home.
