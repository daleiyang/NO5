The man released from prison was barely recognizable, but Parvana knew who he was.



Though his white shalwar kamiz was now gray and tattered, though his face was pale and ravaged, 



he was still her father. 



Parvana clung to him so tightly that Mrs. Weera had to pull her away so that Daddy could lie down.



“We found him on the ground outside the prison,” said one of the men who had helped him get home to Mrs. Weera. 



“The Taliban let him out, but he couldn't go anywhere on his own. 



He told us where he was staying, so my friend and I put him on a karachi and brought him here.”



Parvana sat on the toshak with her father, hugged him and cried. 



She knew the men stayed behind and drank tea, 



but it wasn't until they got up to leave to make it back home in time for curfew, 



that she remembered to be polite. 



She stood up.



“Thank you for helping Dad home,” she said.
