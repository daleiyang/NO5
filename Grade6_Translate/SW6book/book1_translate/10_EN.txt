Helping her father go to the market allowed her to be outside for a few hours every day.



She was always happy to go outside, 



even if it meant sitting for hours on a blanket spread out on the hard ground of the marketplace. 



At least there was something to do. 



She had even got used to keeping quiet and covering her face.



She was small for her eleven years. 



As a little girl, she could usually be outside without being questioned.



“This girl has to support me when I walk”,



her father used to reply to the Taliban who asked, pointing to his leg. 



He had lost his lower leg when the secondary school where he was a teacher was bombed. 



He had also suffered internal injuries and was often tired.



“I don't have a son at home, except for a little two-year-old,” he explained.



Parvana used to slump even more on the blanket and try to look smaller. 



She was afraid to look up at the soldiers. 



She had seen what they did, especially to women, how they used to whip and beat those they thought should be punished.



While she had been sitting there in the marketplace day after day, she had also seen a lot.
