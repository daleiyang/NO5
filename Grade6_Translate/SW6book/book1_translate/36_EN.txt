“Mom, turn on the light!” She suddenly remembered something and sat up straight.



“Quiet, Parvana! You'll wake Ali.”



“Turn on the light,” whispered Parvana. “If they let Dad go, he needs to see a light in the window so he can find his way home.”



“How would he find his way? He left his cane behind. 



Go to sleep, Parvana. You're not making it any easier for us.”



Parvana lay down again, but she did not sleep.



The only window in the room was small and it was high up on the wall. 



The Taliban had ordered all the windows to be painted black so that no one could see the women inside. 



“We won't do it,” my father had said. The window is so high and so small that no one can see in anyway.” 



So far, no one had said anything about it still being unpainted.



For brief moments, when the weather was fine, the sun shone through the window with a thin beam. 



Ali and Maryam used to sit in the sunbeam. Mom and Nooria would join them, 



and for a few brief moments the sun warmed the skin on their arms and faces. 



Then the earth continued to spin, and the sunbeam disappeared. 



Parvana kept her eyes fixed on where she thought the window was.
