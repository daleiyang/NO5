“Who are you, my boy?”



Parvana looked up into a strange face. She stepped back.



“I thought it was my father,” she said with tears on her cheeks. 



The man put his hand on her shoulder.



“You seem like a good boy. I'm sorry I'm not your father.” 



He hesitated and then said in a lower voice:



“Is your father in prison?”



Parvana nodded.



“It happens sometimes that people are released from prison. Don't give up hope.”



The man continued his way between the market stalls, and Parvana returned to her blanket.



One afternoon, as Parvana was shaking the blanket before heading home, 



she saw something colorful on the gray wool. 



She bent down and picked it up.



It was a small embroidered piece of cloth, 



no more than five centimeters long and two and a half centimeters wide.



Parvana had never seen it before. 



As she wondered where it had come from, 



her eyes wandered up to the black-painted window where she thought she had seen something moving a couple of weeks before. 



Now it was completely still.
