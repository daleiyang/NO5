Few people in Afghanistan have clean drinking water. 



All the armies have placed landmines in farmers' fields, making it impossible to grow anything there. 



As a result, many people are dying of starvation or diseases caused by malnutrition.



The Taliban militia, an Afghan army, took control of the capital Kabul in September 1996. 



They imposed extremely harsh laws on girls and women. 



All schools for girls were closed, women were no longer allowed to work and they were forced to dress in a particular way.



Books were burned, televisions were smashed and all forms of music were banned.



After that, the Taliban took over more and more of the country. 



Following the terrorist attacks in the USA on September 11, 2001, 



the US and its allies bombed Afghanistan because the Taliban were hiding terrorists. 



The Taliban lost power in Afghanistan in the fall of 2001, but the country is still very, very poor and the people are struggling.
