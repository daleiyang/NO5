It meant that another day had passed and that her family would soon return home.



At the end of August, there was a heavy rainstorm.



Shauzia had already gone home. She had seen the sky darkening and didn't want to get wet.



Parvana was not so wise and she found herself in the middle of the rain. 



She held her arms over the tray to keep her cigarettes from getting wet and ran into a bombed-out house. 



There she would wait out the storm and go home when it was over.



The darkness outside made it even darker inside. 



It took a while for her eyes to adjust. 



While she waited, she leaned against the doorpost and watched the rain turn the sands of Kabul into mud.



Gusts of wind and clouds of rain forced Parvana to go further into the house. 



She hoped there would be no landmines there, 



found a dry spot and sat down. 



The lashing rain drummed rhythmically on the ground. 



Parvana's chin sank lower and lower. After a little while, she fell asleep.



When she woke up, the rain had stopped, but there was no light outside.



“It must be late,” Parvana said aloud to herself.



That's when she heard the sound of a woman crying.
