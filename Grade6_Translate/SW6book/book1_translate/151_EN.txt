A few days before they were to leave for Mazar, 



Parvana was sitting on her blanket in the marketplace when something fell on her head. 



It was a tiny camel made of beads. 



The woman in the window was still alive! She was fine, 



or at least well enough to let Parvana know that she was still there. 



Parvana wanted to jump up and down and dance. 



She wanted to shout and wave up at the painted window. 



Instead, she sat quietly, trying to think of a way to say goodbye.



She had almost made it all the way home that afternoon when she figured out what to do.



On the way back to the market after lunch,



she carefully dug up some wild flowers growing in the bombed-out ruins. 



She had seen them growing there in previous years, 



and hoped she was right that they were the kind that bloomed year after year. 



If she planted the flowers in the place where she used to lay her blanket, 



the woman in the window would realize that she wouldn't come back. 



The flowers would be beautiful to look at.



She hoped they would make a nice gift.



In her usual place in the market, Parvana started to dig up the hard soil by first kicking it with her foot. 



She also used her hands, as well as a stone she found nearby.



The men and boys in the market gathered around her to watch.
