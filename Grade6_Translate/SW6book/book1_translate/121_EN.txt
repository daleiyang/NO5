The princess would wear silk and precious jewelry.



Parvana would lift her onto a fast horse and they would ride through Kabul in a cloud of dust.



“I would need a fast horse,” she said.



“How about one of those?”



Shauzia pointed to a flock of long-haired sheep milling around in the garbage in the marketplace.



Parvana laughed and the girls went back to work.



On her mother's advice, Parvana had bought a few kilos of dried fruits and nuts. 



Nooria and Maryam had put them in small bags, just enough for a snack for one person.



Parvana sold them from her blanket and from the tray.



In the afternoons, she and Shauzia walked around the market looking for customers. 



Sometimes they went to the bus station, but there they had competition.



Many boys were trying to sell things. 



They would run up to someone, stand in the way and shout:



“Buy my chewing gum! Buy my fruit! Buy my cigarettes!” but Parvana and Shauzia were too shy to do that. 



They preferred to wait for customers to come up to them.



Parvana was tired. She wanted to sit in a classroom and be bored in a geography lesson. 



She wanted to be with her friends and talk about homework and games and what they were going to do in the school holidays.
