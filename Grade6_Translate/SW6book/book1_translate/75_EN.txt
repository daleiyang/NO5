On your wedding day, I send you my warmest wishes for the future. 



Your father, my brother, is a good man, and he has certainly chosen a good man to be your husband. 



At first you will find it difficult to be away from your family, but you will have a new family. 



Soon you will feel at home with them. 



I hope you will be happy, 



that you will be blessed with many children and that you will live until your son has sons of his own.



Once you leave Pakistan and return to Afghanistan with your new husband, 



we will probably lose touch. 



Please keep my letter and do not forget me, because I will never forget you.



Your dear aunt, Sohila.’



Parvana stopped reading. The Taliban sat quietly next to her. :



‘Shall I read it again?’



He shook his head and held out his hand for the letter. 



Parvana folded it and handed it back. 



His hands trembled as he put it back in the envelope. 



She saw a tear fall from one of his eyes. 



It rolled down his cheek until it landed in his beard.



‘My wife is dead,’ he said. 'This was among her belongings. 



I wanted to know what was in it.’
