“I have come to fetch my husband!” she repeated, louder, and Parvana pulled harder on the fabric of the burqa.



“My little Malali,” she heard her father's voice inside her head. 



Suddenly she became calm.



“I have come for my father!” she cried.



Mom looked at her through the cloth screen in front of her eyes. 



She took Parvana by the hand.



“I have come for my husband!” she shouted again.



Over and over again, Parvana and her mother continued to shout out their errand. 



More and more men came and stood staring at them.



“Be quiet!” one of the guards ordered. 



“You can't be here! Get out of here! Go back home!”



One of the soldiers grabbed the photo of Parvana's father and tore it up. 



Another started beating her mother with a stick.



“Let go of my husband!” her mother repeated.



Another soldier attacked her and started beating her. He hit Parvana too.



Although he didn't hit her very hard, she fell and was left lying on the pieces of her father's photograph. 



In an instant she had swept them out of sight, into her chador.
