Mommy didn't seem to notice Parvana. She was struggling with the water. 



Her arms ached and the blisters on her feet had started to bleed again, but she didn't think anything of it. 



She went to get water because her family needed it, because her father would have expected it. 



Now that Mrs. Weera was there and her mother had gotten up, 



everything would be easier and she would do her part of the work. 



Out the door, down the stairs, along the street to the crane, then back again, stopping now and then to rest and change arms to carry.



After the seventh bucket, Mrs. Weera stopped her.



“You've filled the water tank and the wash tub, and there's a filled extra bucket. That's enough for a while.”



Parvana was dizzy from all the work she had done without drinking or eating.



She immediately wanted some water. 



“But what are you doing?” Nooria asked as Parvana filled a cup from the water tank. 



“You know it has to be boiled first!”



Unboiled water made you sick, but Parvana was so thirsty that she didn't care. 



She wanted to drink and raised the cup to her mouth.



Nooria snatched it from her.



“Don't be so stupid! The last thing we need right now is for you to go and get sick! How could someone so stupid become my sister!”
