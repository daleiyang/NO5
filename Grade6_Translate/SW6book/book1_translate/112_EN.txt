Several Taliban soldiers stood urging people to enter, yelling at them to hurry up. 



They pushed and shoved people through the stadium gates, 



swinging their sticks to make the slow ones move faster.



“We're trying to avoid those guys,” Shauzia thought. 



She and Parvana slipped past a few groups of men and slipped into the stadium. 



The stands were almost full. 



The girls were a little intimidated by so many people 



and they stayed close to each other as they walked up between the rows of benches to sell their wares. 



“It's very quiet for a football match,” said Shauzia. 



“The game hasn't started yet. 



Maybe they will start cheering when the players come out on the field.” 



Parvana had seen sports on TV, 



and the people in the stands always used to cheer. 



No one cheered. The men didn't seem happy to be there at all. 



“This is really weird,” Parvana whispered in Shauzia's ear.



“Watch out!” 



A large group of Taliban soldiers walked out onto the field near the girls. 



They crouched so low that they could see the field, 



but so that the Taliban could not see them.
