“What do you mean?”



“I've started to grow,” Shauzia whispered. 



“My body is changing. 



If it changes too much, I'll become a girl again, and then I'll be stuck here.



You don't think I'll grow too fast, do you?



Maybe I should leave before spring comes. 



I don't want things to start growing on me all of a sudden.”



Parvana didn't want Shauzia to leave, 



but she tried to be honest with her friend.



“I don't remember what it was like for Nooria.



Mostly I watched how her hair grew. 



But I don't think you grow like that suddenly. 



I think you have time.”



Shauzia started kicking the wall again. 



Then she stood up so as not to be tempted.



“That's what I hope.”



“Then you will leave your family. What will you eat?”



“It can't be helped!” 



Shauzia's voice grew shrill and faltered as she tried not to cry.



“I just have to get out of here. 



I know it makes me a bad person, but I have no choice. 



I'll die if I have to stay here!”



Parvana remembered how her mother and father had argued. 



Her mother had demanded that they leave Afghanistan, her father insisted that they stay. 



For the first time, Parvana wondered why her mother had simply not left.
