Shauzia leaned against her board.



“Depends on what kind of people they were. 



If they were mean, irritable types, they wouldn't like it. 



If they were kind, generous people, they wouldn't mind.”



“Would you like it?”



Shauzia looked at her, opened her mouth to say something, 



but then closed it again and went back to her digging. 



Parvana asked no more questions.



A few minutes later, Parvana came across a skull.



“Hey, look at this!”



She used the board to loosen the soil around it, 



and then dug out the rest with her fingers so it wouldn't break. 



She held it up in front of Shauzia like a trophy.



“It's grinning.”



“Of course it's grinning,” said Shauzia. 



“He's happy to be out in the sun after being in the dark earth for so long. 



You're happy, aren't you, Mr. Fool?”



She made the skull nod.



“There, you see? What did I tell you? Put it on the tombstone. It can be our mascot.”



Parvana placed it carefully on the broken tombstone.



“He'll be like a boss over us, watching over us to make sure we do the right thing.”
