The wind must have carried the little piece of embroidered fabric to her blanket, 



even though there hadn't been much wind that day.



But when she found a bracelet on the blanket at the end of the day a few days later, 



she couldn't blame the wind. She looked up at the window.



It was open. It swung out from the wall of the house.



Parvana went closer to get a better look. 



In the narrow opening she saw a woman. 



The woman smiled quickly at Parvana and then closed the window.



A few days later, Parvana sat and watched as the tea boys ran back and forth between their customers and the tea stall. 



One of the boys almost collided with a donkey. 



Parvana laughed and looked away as one of the boys tripped over something near her and dropped a tray of empty bricks all over the blanket.



The boy had fallen face down in the gravel in front of Parvana. 



She helped him gather up the glasses that had rolled away. 



She handed him the tray and saw his face for the first time. 



She gasped and put her hand over her mouth.



The tea boy was a girl from her class.
