It was actually her decision.



Once she understood that, it was somehow easier to say yes.



“All right,” she said. “I'll do it.”



“Well done,” said Mrs. Weera. “That's the spirit.”



Nooria waved her scissors in the air again.



“I'll cut your hair,” she said.



“I'll do that,” said Mom, taking the scissors from her. 



“We'll do it right now, Parvana. 



It won't be any easier if we put it off.”



Parvana and her mother went into the washroom, where it would be easier to sweep up the cut hair from the cement floor. 



Mom took Hossain's clothes inside with her.



Do you want to watch?” Mom asked, nodding toward the mirror.



Parvana shook her head, but then changed her mind. 



If this was the last time she would see her long hair, she wanted to look at it for as long as possible.



Mom worked quickly. First she cut off a large tassel. 



She held it up for Parvana to see.



“I have a beautiful ribbon tucked away,” she said.



“We'll tie it around the lock of hair, and you can keep it.”



Parvana looked at the hair her mother was holding. 



It had felt important while it was still on her head. 



Now it didn't feel important anymore.
