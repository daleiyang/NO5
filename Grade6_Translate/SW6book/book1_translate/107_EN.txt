“You're all wet,” Maryam said as soon as Parvana came in the door.



“Are you all right?” Mom rushed towards her.



“Where have you been? Why didn't you come home for lunch?”



“I was working,” Parvana said. 



She tried to turn away, but her mother held her firmly by the shoulders.



“Where have you been?” Mom repeated. 



“We've been sitting here terrified that you'd been arrested!”



Everything she had seen and done during the day was now replaying in Parvana's head. 



She threw herself on her mother's neck and cried. 



Mom hugged her until she calmed down and could talk again.



“Now tell me where you have been all day.”



Parvana realized that she couldn't see her mother's eyes when she told her story, 



so she pressed herself against the wall and told it like it was.



“I was digging up graves.”



“What did you say you did?” Nooria asked.
