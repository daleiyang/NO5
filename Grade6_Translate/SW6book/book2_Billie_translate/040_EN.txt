Alvar is a person I would not normally notice. 



He looks far too sad. 



At the same time, he is not tragic enough to make me wonder what the problem is.



Mange left early because his first class already started at 8:10. 



I want to ask Alvar if it's hard to have a father who is a PE teacher at the same school he goes to, but it feels too early.



Alvar has barely said hello to me yet. 



When I try to joke, he continues to be serious. 



Could there be a different sense of humor in Bokarp? 



I decide to ask ordinary, normal questions.



Do you like school?”



What?”



Is it fun at school?”



A diffuse murmur.



What do you usually do at recess?”



Mumbles. Harkling.



What did you say?”



No answer.



You play soccer, right?”



Sometimes.”



What are your friends' names?”



Silence.



Do you have any friends?”



Yes, I do.



What is his or her name?”
