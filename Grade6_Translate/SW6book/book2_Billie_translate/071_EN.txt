We thought everyone here was boring and quiet. I tried to talk, but no one said anything back. 



Can't they laugh in Sweden?” I thought.”



What happened next?” I ask.



I love Solkullen,” she replies. “I love my job too, but I still dream of Stockholm.” 



She turns to Evin and makes a face.



But my children are so boring. They don't want to move at all.”



It's clear that Evin doesn't want me to know that she's the type who wants to stay in Bokarp. 



She grabs me by the arm and pulls me out of the kitchen before I have had time to ask the mother more questions. 



Seconds later she tells me to come along to the table tennis training and picks out extra training clothes and towel. 



I text Petra that I'm going to the hall and get a text back that I'm going home with Mange and Alvar afterwards.



I sit on Evins parcel rack. I have never done that before. 



No one I know rides a bike. No one in town sits on someone else's rack. 



In the city it's dangerous to ride a bike, not here. There are hardly any cars. 



Evin starts singing “Man in the mirror” again. I join in. 



Those we pass stare with bird's nest mouths. We park the bike outside the hall. 



Evin wants to walk arm in arm to the entrance. I see that she is proud to come with me.
