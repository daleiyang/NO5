Mom pouts sourly at me. “I know that.”



I'll never be able to come home again if you don't get your act together. Don't you get it?”



Mom looks down at the covers. 



I know how she gets when you make demands on her, like against everything.



After a few seconds she looks up.



I'll try, Billie. Of course I will.”



I can't sleep, of course. 



Even though I've rearranged the room, it doesn't feel like mine. 



I sneak upstairs and go to the bathroom. 



I look at Teas and Alvar's toothbrushes and smell the soap that is shaped like a shell. 



It's so beautiful you don't want to wash with it. 



Everything in here is bright yellow, both the tiles and the towels. 



There are towels of the same color on the shelf, neatly folded. 



Not a speck of dust to be seen, no dirt in the sink or splashes of toothpaste on the mirror. 



I sit down on the freezing cold toilet seat.



My feet look lonely on the white tiles.



At Olga's classroom, the bathroom floor is warm. I love it.



Back in the room, I go to the window. 



At first, all I see are trees and grass, the cottage and a glimpse of the neighbor's roof. 



Then I notice something else. 



Petra, standing in the corner of the garden, watering a small, delicate tree. 



She is wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt. Her blonde hair is fluttering in the wind.



The water in the jug is running out. But she stands there, motionless, staring at the tree. 



I can't breathe.
