WE JUST ATE yogurt, granola and homemade whole wheat bread. 



I tried to adapt and said that the muesli was delicious. 



It wasn't. It both looked and tasted like dust. 



The only thing I could think of was toast with marmalade. 



On the table was a newspaper that they took turns reading. 



I wondered why they didn't read it on the tablet or on their cell phones. 



Petra pointed to things in the paper that she wanted to talk about, 



like what's happening in Israel right now. 



It was fun to discuss. 



I asked about Israel and she told me that once upon a time there was a country called Palestine that the Jews got after the Second World War, 



but then there were problems with the people already living there. 



I had never heard of this, and I said so. 



And that it was crazy that they were still fighting.
