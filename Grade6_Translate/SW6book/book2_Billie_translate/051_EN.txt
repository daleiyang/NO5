It turns out that Petra has left work early for me. 



She has even baked scones, which are warm under a towel in the bread basket. 



I'm thirsty and grab a glass from the dish rack. 



Petra shows me some hooks on the wall, where three plastic cups of different colors are hanging.



'I've hung up a mug for you,' she says.



I look at her questioningly.



The red one is Alvar's and the blue one is Tea's. I thought the green one would be yours.”



I still don't understand.



There's so much washing up if you take a new glass every time you drink,” she explains. 



It's better to have your own cup.”



It's all so strange that there's nothing to say. 



I take the green box and fill it with water.



We sit down at the table. Petra sits on the far end of the chair. 



She doesn't eat the scones, just looks at me, fingering her necklace. 



It's cold and dead silent. It's so quiet here all the time. 



The only thing you hear is the wall clock ticking and some birds chirping.



At home we have a busy road outside the window. 



We hear cars around the clock, honking and braking. 



We hear ambulances and fire engines, 



gangs shouting on the way to or from a soccer game, or people just drunk and yelling. 



But here, quiet.
