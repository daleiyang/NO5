I look from one to the other. Filippa stays close, close to Evin. 



She wants to be Evin's best friend, that much I understand. 



The question is whether Evin wants the same thing with Filippa. 



Evin is always looking at me, Mickis and the others too. 



They want to know what I think about things. They laugh at everything I say. 



On the other side of the schoolyard sits Nadine with Ayo. 



Nadine with the long brown hair, Nadine with the worried deer eyes. 



I've already had time to think things about Nadine, things that have nothing to do with her lying. 



I've thought that she seems to be inside glass, just like Petra.



Is she new too?” I ask.



Sort of. They moved here maybe six months ago.”



You've never been to her house?”



Mickis shakes her head quickly. “We don't even know where she lives. No one is allowed to go there. Not even Ayo.”



Have you asked?”



They have. In the beginning they tried to get her to come to a girls' dinner, but she never showed up. 



Even though it's been months since they moved here, she's never told anyone where she lives. 



I wonder how you manage to stay secret for as long as Nadine has in a place this small.



My mom says her mom didn't come to the parents' meeting,” says Evin.



'She's sick like half the time,' says Mickis, poking at the gravel with the tip of his shoe.
