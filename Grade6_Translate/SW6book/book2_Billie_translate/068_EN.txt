I'm like everyone else at school. I laugh when people make jokes. 



I say the right things, dress the right way, eat the right amount in the canteen. 



I say I love potato buns too. 



I don't talk about cool stuff in Stockholm, not about all my series.



What I'm especially careful about: running away without telling you why. 



It's hardly possible to go and pee without the other girls asking where you're going. 



When you come out of the toilet, someone is waiting outside. 



I wish they knew that I sing so loudly to myself sometimes that people around me think I've gone mad.



Everyone seems so happy that I've joined the class. 



They keep saying that I'm cute and funny. 



It warms my heart when they talk like that. 



And when they fight to sit next to me in class.
