Mange and Petra decide that everyone gets it, since I have just arrived.



I end up with Cecilia on the sofa while the family cleans up in the kitchen. 



The clatter of dishes is heard, but no voices. 



Those who were so careful to talk at dinner. 



But maybe it was for me?



Cecilia fiddles with her bracelet and looks at a dry bouquet of flowers hanging on the wall. 



I think she's thinking about what it will be like for me here. 



She doesn't really want to leave me alone. Not already and with strangers. 



But there's nothing you can do, it is what it is.



I have to go,” she says.



It will be fine.



I'm sure.”



Her gaze clings to my face. 



I try to radiate confidence. “Very safe.”



No one finds it easy to suddenly get a new family,” she says so low I can barely hear.



I'm just staying here temporarily.



You know you can call me. Whenever you want.”



And mom. I can call mom.”



Yes.



An hour later, I say goodbye to her at the front door. 



I immediately regret trying to hide from her at the train station.
