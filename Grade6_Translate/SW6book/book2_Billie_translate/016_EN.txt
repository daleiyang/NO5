Cecilia gives me a stern look. 



She might think I'm trying to be cocky, but I'm not. 



I really wonder why safety is good. 



If I had to choose between “safe” and “fun”, I would choose “fun”.



But I don't have time to say that before Cecilia takes over the conversation. 



She starts asking about Alvar and his sister called Tea. 



I find out that Alvar plays ping pong and loves to do arts and crafts in the little house and that Tea loves to dress up. 



I try not to be disappointed.



Sounds like fun, doesn't it, Billie?” Cecilia says.



“Of course,” I say.



When we drive into Bokarp, I don't notice it. 



Seriously, I think it's the road that goes on.



Here it is!” Petra suddenly says.



In the same second, Mange brakes and the engine shuts off. 



Can this really be true? 



Outside the window is a brown house, which can only be described as a “brown house”. 



There is nothing else to say about it. I look around. 



Everywhere there are other almost identical houses, but in different colors. 



I reluctantly get out of the car.



An old lady comes walking with one of those carts that old people roll in front of them. 



She lights up when she sees Petra.



“Thank you for your kind words! I could listen to you forever and ever.”
