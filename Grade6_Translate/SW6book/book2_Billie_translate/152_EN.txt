IT'S SATURDAY and Petra has decided that we will play board games. 



First we eat tacos, and then we have ice cream with meringues. 



Mange calculates how many meringues you can have per person and there are no more than four each. 



Tea gently asks if she can watch the TV program that everyone in her class is watching. 



Don't you want to play games?‚Äù Petra asks. You can hear in her voice that she is disappointed.



Tea is not standing up for herself. She knows the drill: on Saturday nights you spend time with your family. 



You take it in turns to choose the game. Last week it was Petra who chose and then it was Scrabble. 



Today Mange has chosen Monopoly. 



Since I've never played Monopoly, I think it will be fun. 



Mange and Petra will be very happy when they get on the right street and can buy a house. 



Something tells me that they will be extra happy because Alvar and Tea will realize that we are having a good time.
