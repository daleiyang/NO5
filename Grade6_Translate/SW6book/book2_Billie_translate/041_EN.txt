Uh...



We pass a lot of houses that look similar to the Perssons. 



Then come some other more narrow houses. 



Then comes a boring brick building, and another boring brick building. 



So there aren't many people around, apart from a few other children on their way to school. 



Every now and then, but not very often, a car drives by.



Where is everyone?” I ask.



Who are they?”



The next second we are there. 



The school consists of three low buildings forming a U, with a schoolyard in the middle. 



Everything is so tiny that I want to turn around.



At home I go to a school with eight hundred pupils. 



Here, there can hardly be room for more than a hundred children, maybe not even that. 



Of course, I had understood that Bokarp would be something other than Stockholm, but this almost depresses me.



Alvar and I step into the schoolyard. Here and there, children stand in clusters. 



As we approach, they turn around and stare. Could it be me who is so interesting?



Maybe it is. My body starts to tingle, but not in a bad way.



“Hello, hello,” I say.



They look at each other as if I speak a different language.



The children look like the children at home. The clothes and hairstyles are the same.
