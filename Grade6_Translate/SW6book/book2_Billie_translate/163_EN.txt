Do you know how disgusting perfect people are? Do you know how much I hate you?”



I'm standing there trying to think of something to say when I hear shouting and angry voices. 



Filippa and I look towards the door at the same time. In a second we are back in the hall. 



The first thing I see is Petra with a hand over her mouth.



The game has stopped in the room. On the floor between the tables, two boys are fighting. 



Alvar is pounding for all he's worth, Douglas is trying to defend himself. 



Mange comes running and tears them apart. Seconds later they are on their feet. 



Alvar looks like he wants to claw the eyes out of Douglas, who has lost his cocky mask.



Shut up!” Alvar yells, looking like anything but himself. 



Can't you just get out of my life?”



I turn to Petra who is standing stiffly next to me.



What's with those two?” I ask.



You know Douglas is Alvar's cousin, right? My brother's boy.”



I take a deep breath. “No, how could I know that when no one has said anything?”



The cell phone rings in the pocket of my track jacket. It says Cecilia's name on the display. I answer it.
