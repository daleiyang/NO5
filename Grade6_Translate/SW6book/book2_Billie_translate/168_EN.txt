But today we are law-abiding,” I say. 



You can't break the rules twice in the same month.”



Alvar smiles. Maybe he's learning my sense of humor. 



That would certainly help.



Actually, I want to ask him about Douglas.



No one has given me a proper explanation. 



What happened between Petra and Douglas' father? 



There are many questions to be answered. But not yet. 



The Persson family needs some breathing space, as they say.



I'm forcing Alvar to tell us about people we meet instead. 



He tries hard to think of things. 



I learn that an old man has worked as a policeman but has been suspended for committing a crime himself, 



that an old lady moved back to Bokarp from Thailand, leaving her whole family behind, 



and that a guy in a wheelchair was in a car accident last year when his friend drove drunk. 



It never occurred to Alvar that the people of Bokarp might be exciting, 



but I tell him about it.



I spot Nadine walking hand in hand with her mother. 



Surely that's one thing you don't do in Bokarp, holding your mother's hand when you're twelve years old. 



But Nadine doesn't care about that. That makes me happy. Nadine and I wave to each other. 



We share a secret. Not even Alvar will know.
