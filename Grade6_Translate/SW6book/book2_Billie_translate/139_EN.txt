For example, there is a cream that smoothes things out in the skin. 



I ask her what needs to be smoothed out in my skin. 



She says it's common to have imperfections and gives me a comforting pat. 



Then she tells me why she loves it. 



Her eyes get dreamy as she tries to find the right words. 



She can sit for hours. Time slips away. It's her and the makeup.



As if the makeup was a teddy bear?” I ask.



She nods as if I actually understood.



Do you squeeze the mascara before you go to sleep too?”



Giggles.



I ask how it is at school. 



Tea says that the only one who is nice is Fatima, but Mange and Petra don't seem to want her around.



Why not?” I ask.



Maybe because she lives on Solkullen.”



What's so dangerous about that?”



Tea shrugs. “They've been hysterical since...”



Since...?”



She tries to open a clear plastic box of thin paintbrushes, tugging impatiently at the lid. “Ohhhh!”



Then Casper...?”



Tea turns to me in a flash. “Bye.”



I really, really wonder why it's so dangerous to talk to each other. 



How could the social services think it would be better for me to live here?
