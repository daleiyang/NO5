Petra asks several times what it was like at school. 



I answer several times that everyone was very nice. 



In the middle of a sentence, she turns to Alvar and looks at him sternly.



Not so much butter!”



Alvar obediently scrapes off half.



I love butter!” I say. “When I was younger, I ate butter with a spoon.”



Alvar looks at me worriedly from under his bangs. Maybe he's nervous about what Petra will think. 



But she says nothing. I put two scones on my plate.



Eni taget!”



After the scones, she says we're going for a walk.



Alvar slips out before she has time to ask if he wants to come along. 



Through the window I watch him hurry across the grass in his plastic slippers 



and enters a small red cottage a short distance from the house, next to a giant apple tree.



What is he going to do?”



Petra doesn't seem to understand the question.



What is Alvar going to do in the cabin?” I ask again.



“Well ...”, she shrugs thoughtfully, ”Alvar likes to be alone and do his own thing.”



I get a fierce urge to run in and interrupt.



Petra and I walk through the area with similar houses. 



She looks frozen, walks stiffly with her shoulders hunched.
