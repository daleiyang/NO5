EVIN AND THE OTHERS are like flies around me at school.



I tell them that I have tried to talk to Nadine, but failed to get any information. 



They ask me to keep trying because the atmosphere among the girls is so bad when you choose to be outside.



Nadine doesn't have the right apps on her phone, doesn't play ping-pong. 



She does what you can't do in Bokarp: choose solitude. 



They talk about how strange it is not to want to hang out, not to join groups online or on their cell phones, not to care. 



I get worried that they'll realize that I'm not really to be counted on either.



After having grazed most of the girls in the class, I can't bear to go home with anyone else. 



I blame the Persson family for thinking I've been away too much. 



But two days a week I play table tennis anyway, and then Evin and I cycle to the sports hall together.
