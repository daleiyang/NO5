I've read books and watched TV about bullying. 



It doesn't seem like much fun to have your head shoved down a toilet. 



If anyone here is going to get an idea like that, it's probably that Douglas guy and his spazzy friend. 



I try to pretend they don't exist, but it's hard because Douglas is really staring hysterically.



Roya starts talking about how amazing it is that I have come to class. 



I smile so much that my jaw hurts. Evin whispers secretly that Roya is not like everyone else. 



I want to ask what's wrong with that, but I think about what my mom and I agreed.



The lesson starts and it's about volcanoes.



When the teacher tells us to pick up the books, Evin makes an ugly face that makes me laugh. 



During the lesson I am busy fantasizing about my new classmates, who they are and where they come from. 



One girl has long brown hair and the most doll-like face I've ever seen in real life. 



I bet her name is Nadine and she's the cutest girl in school. 



A guy sitting behind her pokes her with a pencil. 



When she turns around, he pretends it's nothing. The guy sitting next to her whispers things in Nadine's ear. 



But Nadine just sits there and doesn't seem to listen.



She thinks she's something just because her dad lives in London,‚Äù Evin whispers in my ear.
