My thoughts keep going to Petra.



“I wonder what that was all about,” I say, ”with the hug.”



“What year?



Why Petra got so sad.”



Filippa stops under a street lamp, so I can clearly see that she is enjoying having the answer. “You don't know?”



Know what?”



Seriously? No one told you?”



What?”



Filippa shoots her chin up triumphantly. “That Casper died two years ago.”



Casper?”



Petra and Mange's children. Alvar and Tea's little brother. Didn't they tell you?”



I feel like I've been punched in the stomach.



Filippa stands there with a teasing look in her eyes, waiting for a reaction. 



I straddle the bike, put my foot on the pedal and push off.



I don't stop until I reach the driveway. 



There is light between the trees, from the window of the cottage. 



I hurry across the grass. Catching my breath before I yank open the door. 



He's sitting at the table, fiddling with a new old man.



Why haven't you said anything?”



Alvar flickers his eyes. “About what?”



“Casper.”
