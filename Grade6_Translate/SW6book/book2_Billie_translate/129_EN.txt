The worst thing in the world must be to move,” says mom, who has no choice.



I tell this to Mange while we are running, as a funny story. 



But Mange is not laughing. He asks anxious questions about her health. 



I tell him she has a doctor she goes to all the time, but nothing about all the pills she takes.



I want to ask about Casper, but I don't dare. We talk about funny movies instead. 



We think the same actors are funny. 



I say lines in English and he has to guess which movies they come from. 



He says I sound like a real American.



That sounds great!” I reply.



I tell him I like horror movies and he forgets for a second that I'm a kid and shouldn't know everything about scary movies. 



Mange has a secret collection of movies in the basement that the kids don't know exist, he reveals, movies that Petra hates. 



It turns out that I have seen several of them.



“They may not be that useful,” says Mange, ”but I can't help liking them anyway.”



I promise to keep quiet. Mange looks at me with respect. 



As a joke, I hide behind a tree in the forest and jump out right in front of him.



Mange is terrified, screams and takes a leap straight into an anthill. 



I help him to brush the ants away.
