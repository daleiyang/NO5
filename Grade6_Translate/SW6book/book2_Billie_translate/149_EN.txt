Perhaps the best thing would be to get rid of all the people asking me to go home with them after school.



Half an hour before the end of the last lesson, I tell them I have a stomach ache and have to go home. 



Roya follows me anxiously with her eyes. 



She asks the class to finish writing in the exercise book and walks with me out into the empty corridor. 



We sink down on the bench outside the classroom.



Is it the stomach flu?”



I shake my head.



What is it then?”



Now I realize that Roya is just like me. That she can see things.



I'm so worried about Nadine,” I whisper. “Her dad beats her mom and they have to move all the time.



“I know.



Do you?”



Roya nods seriously. “Yes. Now there are two of us who know.”



In the same second, a weight is lifted off my shoulders.



I don't know where she lives,” Roya continues, 



“and I can't reveal that Nadine goes to the school. I won't do that either.”



The other girls want to know everything about Nadine, but...”



You don't want to tell them?”



No, but I don't want to be alone either.”
