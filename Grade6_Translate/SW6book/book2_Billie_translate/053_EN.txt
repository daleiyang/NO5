There's something about her face when she thinks no one is looking. 



Her eyes are sad and her forehead creases. 



But then she turns to me, nods towards one of the houses and says that the woman who lives there has a hairdressing salon in the garage.



In the car?” I ask.



Petra laughs. “No, they keep the car outside.”



Outside the area, she points to a yellow brick building. 



It's the parish hall. We usually have various events there. 



Church coffee after mass on Sundays. Various cultural activities.”



I feel a bit sorry for Petra, who probably mostly meets people who don't really believe, but just go to church because it's something you do.



Will there be any?” I ask. “At your meetings.”



Oh yes, many.”



Aunts and old men?”



Petra nods reluctantly. “Well, maybe it's mostly old men and women. 



But we have youth meetings too. And the gospel choir of course.”



No one I know believes in God.”



Maybe they just don't want to talk about it.”



No,” I say. “You don't believe nowadays.”



There's fashion in many things, but not in God.” Petra sounds determined in her voice.



No one can believe that he made a man out of a bone, can they?” She opens her mouth, 



but I beat her to it so she doesn't have to defend herself.
