That I have several episodes to catch up on my series.”

If I don't show them where I stand now, you never know what they might come up with in the future.



Mange drags his fingers back and forth across his chin. 



We'll have to take it gradually. A little at a time.”



Petra looks at him in amazement. “Okay?”



“It can't be easy for her with all these new rules.



I'm not very good at rules,” I say.



Petra winces. Seconds later, she smiles. But it doesn't really look like a smile.



After they leave, I stay in bed with an uneasy feeling in my stomach. 



I wonder what “rules” mean. 



What if they think I'm going to do what they say all the time? 



What if they think I'll be as calm and well-behaved as Alvar? 



What if they imagine that I can be like a completely normal Bokarp child.



I turn on my episode again. 



The love scene ends and there is terror in a department store. 



Even though it's exciting, I find it hard to concentrate. 



There's that feeling in my stomach that it might not be so easy here.



At half past nine I turn on skype. 



The assistant has left and mom has come to bed.
