'A lot of people think pink is nice,' I say.

She stares at my hair, at my long, hard sausages. 



You can tell she'd like to touch them.

Tea looks at her mom. Petra smiles and nods as if to say that everything is okay.

Why?” asks Tea.



I don't know why. But they're fun.” 



I shake my head so that the hard sausages shoot out like slingshots around my head.

Ping-pong competitions,” says Tea. “But that was when I was eight.”



She was very good,” says Mange from the doorway.



I wasn't,” says Tea in a low voice. “I only came joint third.



Several times.”
