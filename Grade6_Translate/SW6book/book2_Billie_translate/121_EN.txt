I would have agreed, of course, whining about Evin always being in charge, 



until I became more friends with Filippa than with Evin. Evin would be left out.



Maybe I could be the new Evin then. Would I have taken the chance?



People of all ages have gathered in the parish hall. I am immediately in a great mood. 



I didn't know there were people in Bokarp I'd never seen before.



I tell a teenage girl that I am new to the community.



She seems to like me, picks at my hair just the right amount and says that she has longed for Stockholm all her life. 



Now there are only a couple of years left before she finishes high school and can move, she says. 



I glance at Filippa. She's standing in a corner and radiates sulkiness. 



I should probably let everyone know that I'm here with her.



Before we start singing, I raise my hand and ask what a gospel is. Filippa rolls her eyes.



Petra tells me that it's a kind of church music that reminds me a bit of the blues and comes from the USA.



â€œNot that I know what the blues is, but the fact that it's more fun than the hymns sounds good. 



And when we start singing, I immediately notice how the music makes my body bubble, 



just like when I listen to Michael Jackson. 



I forget at once that I'm in Bokarp and I'm singing for all I'm worth.
