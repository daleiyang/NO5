Yes.” And then I sing a Michael Jackson song to my mom on the screen. 



You are not alone. I am here with you. Though we're far apart. You're always in my heart.”



I sing as much to myself as to her, I sing because I have to: 



You are not alone. I am here with you. Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart.



I kiss the screen and turn it off.



Then I hear Petra's voice from downstairs: 



You have to turn off the computer now! Two hours is the maximum, Alvar!”



I open the window to get some air, 



stick my head out into the open and breathe until the restlessness inside has calmed down a bit. 



In the middle of a breath I see the little cottage. There is light in the windows. 



At the same moment, I realize that Petra has called out to an empty room. I smile to myself. 



Alvar has a life of his own out there. That alone gives me hope.
