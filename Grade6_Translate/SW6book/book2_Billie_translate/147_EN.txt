If you tell Petra about your horror movies,” I say.



He smiles nervously and closes the door.



I call my mom back on skype. “I don't want to adapt anymore.”



“Oh,” my mom says happily.



Why did you encourage me to try?”



It was you who encouraged yourself.”



We sit quietly and look at each other. 



There's another knock and Alvar sticks his head in. 



When he sees that I'm Skyping with mom, he's about to close.



Don't go,” I say. “We were just about to stop talking.”



We were?” Mom says, surprised. “We wouldn't, would we?”



Yes, we would. Because I'm going to be with Alvar now.”



I turn off Skype and ask Alvar if he wants to watch my show. 



He nods and lies down next to me in bed and I explain everything that happened in the first five episodes. 



Alvar's body rests so comfortably against mine.



When he laughs, it's in a way that makes me feel good. 



I couldn't fall in love with Alvar, it's not that. 



When I was little, I fantasized about having a brother,



how much fun it would be to have siblings, to have a dad,



with grandma and uncle and cousins to visit.



Just to feel how it feels, I lean my head against Alvar's shoulder. 



I'm almost sure he likes it too.
