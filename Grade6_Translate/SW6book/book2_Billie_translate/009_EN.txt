“Sweetheart, what luck ... I thought you were on, 



but you can't do that, you have to answer your cell phone anyway, 



What if I'd stayed on the platform? 



then you would have had to go all the way yourself, that wouldn't have been very good ... .”



With a sigh I sink down on the seat. “There's no need for you to come along.” 



“But you can't say that, can you?”



“I'm not exactly a child.”



“When you're twelve, you're a child.”



Her eyes are glued to my face. 



I'm not angry with her, I just think everything is so stupid.



It's easier to travel alone. 



When Cecilia is with me, I have to take care of her too, so that she doesn't feel pointless.



“You'll see, it'll be fine,” she says, sitting down. “It's going to be great.”



“You can't know that.”



“No, I can't, but I think you'll like the family anyway. 



Petra, you know, the mom, is absolutely amazing. 



I've spoken to her several times and she seems to have such an understanding of people.”



She nods, sort of to herself. “So it will be fine.”



It sounds like Cecilia is trying to tell herself things.



She would never know that I'm excited about it and that I'm not that scared.
