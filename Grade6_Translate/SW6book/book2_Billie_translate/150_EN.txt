Roya looks at me for a long time.



It wasn't easy for me at first either,” she finally says. 



As you may know, I'm dating Vendela, who runs the small grocery store. 



Even though we knew it would be hard, we decided that I would move here and live with her.”



I have seen Roya, laughing in a room behind the cash register in the shop with Vendela. 



There is nothing in the world that would make me think there is anything wrong with that.



But I don't know if I would have moved here if I knew it would be as hard as it was.” 



Roya continues in a low voice. “I noticed people staring and talking about us, 



even the children. I started pretending that Vendela and I were just friends. 



I didn't hold her hand when we were out in the village and I never talked about her to people. But in the end ... .”,



Roya shakes her head a little, “I felt like I couldn't breathe anymore, 



and I started thinking that I should break up with Vendela and move back home.”



I soak up every word, 



so grateful to meet a person in Bokarp who talks about things that matter.



What happened next?”



Vendela asked me how I wanted to live my life. If I wanted to be someone else all the time. Walk around and pretend.”



Didn't you want that?”
