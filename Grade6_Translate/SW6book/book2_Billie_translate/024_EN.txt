Not that it matters,” says Petra, ”but we've set the table for you.



Opposite Cecilia. And you've got the nicest napkin rose!”



We sit down together. I praise the crunchy pink thing on the plate. 



Tea has folded it according to a description in a book she received as an Easter present, I am told. 



I've never heard of Easter presents, but I guess they're like Christmas presents. 



Petra says that Tea is very good at everything that has to do with color and shape. 



I wonder if it's only Tea who is good at things and not Alvar.



Mange has made moose roast, as he has a freezer full of moose. 



Apparently his whole family hunts. 



I didn't know that ordinary people are allowed to shoot animals in the forests. 



He paints a vivid picture of setting off at dawn with a tingling feeling in his body, 



how you sneak between the tree trunks with all your senses heightened. 



Your heart goes into your throat when you see the big animal. 



At least that's what Mange says. Cecilia nods with interest.



Can I ask for the potatoes?” Alvar asks.



Mange doesn't listen, just goes on about shooting animals.



Petra gets all stressed out. “Maybe we should change the subject”, she says and gives the potatoes to Alvar.



Have you ever shot a moose?” I ask Mange.



To my surprise, he shakes his head. “Let's talk about something else.”
