She doesn't seem to have a chin at all on the screen. 



Her face flows out like a lump of mud.

I remember all the times my mother didn't make herself up.

People don't usually like her very much and she doesn't like people.



Plus, she's not behaving herself, eating and sleeping badly, just getting stiffer and stiffer,
