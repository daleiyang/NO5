Douglas looks at Salim and makes a face. “At least we don't have African hair.”



Swedish hair!” I say.



Dirty African hair,” says Douglas. “Because it doesn't wash, does it?”



Yes, it does.”



I bet there's lice in every single one of them.”



My head is spinning. “I'm from Stockholm, you idiot. 



And by the way, you have a rather nasty habit of sticking your finger up your nose as I wonder what country it comes from.”



Douglas stares at me. “Did you just call me an idiot?”



Maybe it's not so strange.”



Me, Douglas and Salim all turn to Alvar in surprise.



What did you say?” Douglas asks.



Alvar's face is bright red. “Can't you just shut up?” he hisses and puts his foot on the pedal. 



I get on my bike and glide off after him.



We say nothing the whole way home. It doesn't feel like the right time to ask questions.



But of course I wonder: what happened between Alvar and Douglas that made Alvar hate him so much?



We slow down at the mailbox. Alvar doesn't head for the door but straight out into the garden. 



I follow him. 



He rounds the house and leads the way to the cottage, pretending not to know I'm there. Of course he doesn't. 



I'm just about to shout something angry when he turns around.
