I have no idea what kind of people to look for. 



We've only spoken on the phone once. The train moves on. 



It gets so quiet on the platform that I almost, almost, get scared. 



A crow sits on top of the lamppost and stares at me as if wondering what I'm doing there.



“Maybe they're waiting on the other side,” says Cecilia.



I can see that she's thinking that I'm thinking that it's good that she's there, after all. 



But mostly I'm glad they're late. Maybe they're not as perfect as I thought.



We walk through the small station house and out the other side. 



What seems to be a very small town becomes visible. 



The houses are mostly yellow and have three floors.



I check out a mom with a stroller a bit away, 



a slightly slumped man with a green plastic bag and an elderly lady with a handbag. 



While we wait, I start singing “I want you back” by The Jackson 5.



I always do that when I have to wait. Cecilia is too busy worrying. 



She takes out her cell phone. 



Before she can dial, an ice-blue car pulls into the parking lot. 



The car turns in front of us. Two people fly out.



“Sorry...”



The mother looks at me intensely. 



She is tall and fair and wears fluttery white clothes. 



The father, who has his hair in a minimal ponytail, mutters something similar to “sorry”.
