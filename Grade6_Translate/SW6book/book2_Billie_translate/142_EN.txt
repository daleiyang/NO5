I haven't been too keen on going there before, because it's dark and smells like pee. 



At least that's what Alvar said.



And that he saw a rat there once.



I step carefully into the darkness. 



It smells like Alvar said and is so cold that I have to zip up my neck. 



I talk aloud to myself, about everyday things. I sing happy songs. 



My voice coalesces and turns to mush in the echoing tunnel. 



On the dim, bright yellow lights, people have written disgusting things in black marker.



I stop in the middle. An icy drop lands on the back of my neck, makes its way down my spine. 



After what seems like an eternity, I hear footsteps. What if it's not Nadine? 



What if it's a murderer, or a rapist, or someone in society making fun of my hair.



No, these are just fantasies.



An icy hand against mine. “I can't take it anymore. 



I have no one to talk to. No one else who can understand.”



We had only said a few words to each other at lunch. “Understand what?”



She glances behind her. Seconds later, a moaning sound comes out of her. 



The sound grows in the echoing tunnel. It frightens me. 



Still, I take her hand and stroke her arm.



'I can't take it anymore,' she says again.



“What is it you can't take?



Can you keep quiet?”
