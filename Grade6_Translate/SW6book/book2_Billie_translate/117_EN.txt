When I venture out again, the mother is still sitting on the stairs. She smokes and picks up another cigarette.



Nadine puts a blanket over her mother's shoulders and sits down next to her. 



Her mother puts her arm around Nadine and pulls her to her. Everything is still. 



My chest and stomach start to ache. At first I don't understand why. 



But then it hits me. I long for my mother.



I cycle back to the community. The wind blows through my clothes. 



I love the empty road, being alone, surrounded by forest. 



I sing Michael Jackson as loud as I can. 



At home, I run past the others who are watching TV. 



They want to know where I've been, but I don't answer. 



I crawl under the covers and think. 



Nadine and her mother looked like the loneliest people on earth, the saddest people you ever saw. 



Petra comes in and sits down gently on the edge of the bed.



You don't have to behave all the time, Billie.”



She tilts her head. “I wish we could help you.”



I can help you too.”



No, it's the adults' responsibility to help the children.”



Why?”



She laughs again. I wish I could tell her what she should do: talk to Alvar and Tea, 



tell them why she cares too much one second and too little the next.



You need more sleep,” says Petra. “I know you lie down with your laptop in the evenings after we say goodnight.”
