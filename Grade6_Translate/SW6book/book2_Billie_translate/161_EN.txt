Of course, losing the match would be terribly embarrassing for her and the most fair thing is for her to win.



In the second set, the panic in Filippa's eyes grows. 



She swears loudly when she misses and she shouts “Lucky!” when I get a net roller. 



A head referee from the secretariat comes in and gives her a warning. 



You are not allowed to swear or harass your opponent during a ping-pong match. 



Filippa grits her teeth and keeps playing. 



But she can't get anything right and loses the set 11-5.



I see Evin and Mickis staring in the stands, completely shocked. 



I get the picture: Billie, who has been playing ping pong for a few short weeks, is about to beat Filippa. 



Alvar has lost his first two sets over there.



Now he's standing with Mange, talking tactics for the third. Mange's mouth is moving. 



Douglas has stepped down a few rows of benches. He and Salim are laughing. 



Alvar looks at them and shoots poison darts with his eyes.



He looks for a second like one of the warriors in the army cabin.



The battle between me and Filippa continues. I can see tears in Filippa's eyes. 



What is about to happen must not happen. I deliberately miss a few balls. 



Filippa wins one, two, three and four points. 



I keep pretending and she wins a few more, five, six, seven... In the middle of the set she throws the racket to the floor. 



Her face is bright red.



Tears are flowing. “You're making a fool of yourself!” she screams.
