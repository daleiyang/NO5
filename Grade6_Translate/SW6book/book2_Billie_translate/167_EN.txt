I CYCLE WITH ALVAR On slippery streets covered in autumn leaves. 



The wind in my hair and the freedom that doesn't exist in Stockholm. 



These are the good things. A bike of your own is good. A brother is good. 



The choir and Ping-Pong. The back streets are starting to look more fun. 



There it lives and there it lives. 



We cycle to the kiosk on Solkullen and buy candy. There is the road where Casper died. 



Alvar shows exactly, then there is nothing more to it.



I meet the teenage girl from the choir outside the kiosk.



She is hanging out with some guys who have mopeds or motorcycles, I don't know which. 



She introduces me to them and they want to touch my hair and ask me about Stockholm. 



Alvar stops a bit away.



We move on. Leading the bikes and eating candy.



Last week I ate candy on a Tuesday,‚Äù says Alvar.



He grins at me and strokes his bangs back in that way that I think is cute.
