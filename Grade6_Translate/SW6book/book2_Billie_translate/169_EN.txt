I look after Nadine and her mother as they move on. 



There's a twinge in my chest, but it's not too bad. I know why it feels like that.



In the square, I see the lady with the polka-dotted tights. 



She's giving a monologue to a dog tied to the lamppost. 



I have a hunch and drag Alvar with me into the clothing store. 



I ask the clerk if she has any polka-dotted tights and she goes into a back room to look.



After a few minutes she comes back out, her cheeks flushed with excitement. 



She actually found a pair! 



I ask for them to be wrapped and she makes a package with floral paper and strings in two different colors.



You could win the wrapping world championship!” I say.



The shop assistant thanks me very much.



I cross the square with Alvar. 



The aunt only looks at the dog, not at me. 



I hold out the nice package.



Here you are!”



At first she just stares at it. 



Two seconds later, the package is in her plastic bag. 



She hurries off on her skinny legs.



The Finnish girl is crazy,” says Alvar.



No, she's not. She's normal. So is she.”



Alvar looks at me in wonder.
