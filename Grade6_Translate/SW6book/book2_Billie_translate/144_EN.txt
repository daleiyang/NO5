She's sitting on a park bench just behind the store, talking to herself. 



I go over and ask if I can sit down, but she doesn't answer.



I sit down anyway. Her scent is sour, but not too bad. 



The tear has gotten bigger since the last time I saw her, all the way down to her pink sneakers. 



How old can she be? Forty? Seventy?



... the girl... hell... the walk”, she mutters, ”...the revenge... the justice... the punishment...”



I understand nothing, only that she is talking about things that matter. 



I tell her about mom who is getting sicker and sicker, about silent Alvar, 



angry Tea, frightened Petra, overconfident Mange, 



the whole Persson family with their dead child that no one says a word about, 



I tell them about Evin and the other girls who want me to be like them and about Nadine's secret.



When I've finished, I notice that the aunt has fallen silent.



She sits very still and looks at me in puzzlement.



Her face is full of tiny, tiny dimples. 



She reaches out her skinny hand and gently feels a dreadlock. 



I don't breathe, letting her take her time to examine it. 



The aunt withdraws her hand. She gets up and stumbles away. 



There is a tear on the back of her tights too.
