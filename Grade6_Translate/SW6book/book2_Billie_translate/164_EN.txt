Cecilia says she has something to tell me. 



I move a bit away from the drama.



Your mother has had another relapse,” says Cecilia.



“She's not feeling very well.



But you said I could come home soon?”



Yes ...” You can hear how much Cecilia is suffering from having to tell you.



But she doesn't always do what the doctors say, and now, unfortunately, things have gone completely the wrong way.”



There is silence for a few seconds. 



I want to throw the phone to the ground, but I just stand there paralyzed.



That means you have to stay in Bokarp for now. I'm sorry, Billie.”



When can I go home then? In a month? Two?”



There is silence at the other end.



I can't answer that,” Cecilia finally says.



That's the thing about your mother's illness, you never know with it.”



I see Douglas yelling something over there. 



I see Mange trying to hold Alvar. But I don't care. 



All that matters is that my mother is seriously ill and that she's not taking care of herself, even though she promised. 



What has happened could mean that she won't get me back. The tears well up like lava from a volcano.



There is no point in trying to stop it.



Petra comes out. “Sweetheart ...”



I fall into her arms, sobbing against her thin, white shirt, wetting it with tears and snot.
