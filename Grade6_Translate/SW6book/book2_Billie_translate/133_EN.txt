Just for that, I shouted that I loved the choir and started singing in a gospel way in an exaggerated manner. 



Evin laughed so hard she peeked.



You don't have to be the best singer to sing,” I said as we walked arm in arm to the lesson. 



She agreed with that. Filippa stared angrily.



Evin crawls close and whispers in my ear that I am the coolest in the whole school. 



She asks me to come home with her and cuddle her bunnies.



Even though I like Evin so much, I panic. 



I wish she didn't like me so much, so I wouldn't have to keep saying no to her. 



The easiest thing would be to take Evin home, but I have promised Alvar. 



Besides, I was with Evin at the training yesterday.



I reply that it's not possible. Evin takes a step back.



“Don't you want to be with me anymore?



Of course I do.”



It doesn't feel like it,” Evin says defiantly.



“It's just that I promised Petra and Mange to come home.



Is that so?”



Alvar comes forward. Evin looks from him to me.



In a flash she turns and leaves. Her schoolbag hits her leg angrily. 



I want to call out to her that I'd love to cuddle her rabbits tomorrow, but the words get stuck in my throat.



I remember when I started first grade.
