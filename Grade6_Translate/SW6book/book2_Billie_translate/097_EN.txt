AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK, something called High Mass begins in the church. 



Petra is the leader. Alvar and Tea don't have to go every Sunday, but this week Petra has decided they must. 



“She wants me to understand what their family stands for,” she says. 



But you can't force your faith on someone else.”



Neither Alvar nor Tea seem to believe, so it doesn't really bother them, yet they get up in the morning without protest. 



Petra has disappeared to get ready. As we leave, Mange casts a worried glance at my hair. 



I quickly gather it into a ponytail. He smiles gratefully.



During the bike ride, Mange points out things that Petra forgot to show:
