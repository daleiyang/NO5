EVIN LAUGHS LOUDER than everyone else in Bokarp and makes the sickest faces. 



It's enough to make me want to be with her. 



She also says she's never met a funnier person than me. 



She says that Bokarp was the most boring place in the world before she met me, but she didn't know that then. 



Evin's mother says that Evin feels good about meeting people from somewhere else, Evin tells me, and that the world is too crowded in Bokarp.



I'm allowed to come back to their house for dinner, and I meet his father and little brother. 



Evin takes my hand and says we will be best-friends-forever. 



Her eyes tell me that she is counting on me. 



That feeling creeps in, the feeling from before. 



The one that says no one can count on me and that it will be hard if people expect things. 



The feeling that says if I don't do what Evin wants, it could be a disaster.
