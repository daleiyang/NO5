Help!” I shout.



I glance to the side and see Alvar walking with his head hanging towards one of the tables. 



Douglas is sitting in the stands. He shouts something to Alvar that I can't hear. 



Salim, sitting next to him, grins. Alvar pretends not to notice them. 



Mange is ready at the short end, he will apparently coach. Alvar starts to ball in.



He nervously wipes his forehead with the towel. 



Douglas shouts again from the stands. “...Alvar, please?”



That's all I hear.



Then my match begins. I decide to at least do my best. 



Already after a few balls I notice something strange. 



Filippa's forehand is not that difficult and I get most of the balls over the net. 



Filippa misses all the time, even my most obvious, easiest shots. 



She hisses to herself and looks like she might burst with anger.



'I'm sorry,' I say.



'Shut up, will you?



Both I and the judge hear. But we do not protest.



Filippa grabs the water bottle and sips water furiously.



I win the first set 11-7. 



It is with great surprise that I go over to play the second. 



Filippa moves her arm and grimaces. I understand what she is doing: 



Trying to make people think she's hurt. It's all right with me.
