She laughs at all my jokes. I laugh at hers. 



For real, that is. The others want to ride with us, but Evin says it's up to the two of us. 



Mickis says it's not fair. She also wants to be with me, several more too. 



I know I should tell Evin. 



I should tell her that she can't monopolize me, that we should be able to be together as a couple.



After a while I give in to Petra's nagging and decide to try the gospel choir. 



Filippa is already in it. We ride our bikes together after school and park outside the parish hall. 



Filippa takes my arm and crawls close. “It's so hard with Evin. I love her, so it's not that, but ...”



What?”



She lets out an anguished sigh. “I don't know if you've noticed, with Evin... That she always wants to be in charge.



You have to do what she says, or she gets mad.”



She looks at me innocently. “Right?”



I don't know. I haven't lived here that long so . .”



Filippa lets go of my arm. “I know how Evin is. It's a pain in the ass.”



“But why don't you tell her?



Do you think it's easy?”



But you can try. She might not know you feel that way.”



I'm telling you, it's not possible!”
