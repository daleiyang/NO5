“Hi Billie! I'm Petra.”



I can tell she is unsure whether to hug me or not. 



I want to make it easier for her and dive into her arms. 



Her body is thin and a bit gnarled, but she smells good. 



In the hug, I hear a sound coming from her throat, and realize I might be hugging too hard. 



I let go and hug the father too, but looser. 



He says his name is Mange.



“We're never late,” he says.



“No,” says Petra, ”but sometimes things happen in life that you're not prepared for.”



She is so serious that it becomes funny.



“It's okay,” I say.



Petra smiles beautifully. “We were going to go by the sports hall and get some things, 



but Magnus got stuck with a parent, so... well...”



She looks quickly at Mange. He doesn't seem to have heard. 



I buy that Mange is a sports teacher, but Petra doesn't look like a priest at all. 



Admittedly, I have not met a priest before. 



No one I know has met a priest. 



What do they do during the day, when there are no weddings or school graduations?



“Don't you have a cross?”



Petra looks at me with wide eyes, perplexed.



“Cross?”



“Yes, I thought priests wore crosses around their necks.
