She's disappointed, of course, that she didn't get the big sister she'd hoped for.

Can I leave the table?” Tea asks a little too loudly.



“No, because now Billie has arrived and...”



I think everyone can leave the table,” I say.

Tea looks at Petra. “Does she eat in bed?”



“At home we ask if you can leave the table,” says Petra, fingering the necklace.



I realize that this is important to this family, really important.



“Can I leave the table?” I ask.
