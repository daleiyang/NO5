Soc doesn't think my mom can take care of me,” I say.


Nadine slowly brushes a strand of hair away from her cheek. “You think so?”



No, maybe she can't. But that's okay.”



How?”



I can take care of myself.”



Nadine smiles quickly. “You can't do that when you're twelve, can you?



Maybe you can't.”



Nadine starts eating again. She looks at the food with concern before putting it in her mouth. 



Sometimes she regrets it and takes a little off her fork, spearing another piece lying next to it. 



I think that part of her is asleep. 



I think Nadine has secrets that she hasn't told a single person. 



Why would she reveal anything to me? 



But now it is important not to let the opportunity pass me by. I lean forward over the table.



Sometimes I hate my mom,” I whisper. 



I hate her because I'm not allowed to get angry at her, like other people are allowed to get angry at their parents. 



I hate her because I feel sorry for her. 



But she's my mom, so I love her too ... Sometimes it's like chaos in my head. 



I feel like the only person in the world who has to think about how my mom is all the time.”



Nadine looks at me for a long time.
