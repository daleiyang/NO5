Her eyes light up as she speaks. 



She comes closer and says in a low voice that she has spent all her savings on makeup. 



She calls it an investment. 



By that she means that if she just gets a lot of views, the makeup companies will start contacting her and sending her free products.



But what happens then?” I ask.



What then?”



When everyone in Sweden is looking at you?”



She opens her mouth and closes it again. Clicks on a Miss Pinky video. 



In the video, Tea is wearing a tight pink sweater and makeup with a dead expression on her face. 



She talks in a monotone voice about the make-up and gives suggestions on when to use it: everyday, 



at school or at a birthday party. 



I worry about how the girls in her class will react when they discover Miss Pinky. 



It's not impossible that they will say mean things.



I have an idea,” I say. “You can put on different makeup each time. 



One time as a rock chick, the next time as a monster...”



Tea looks at me like I'm stupid. “What?”



She asks if she can put makeup on me. She does.



I have to volunteer as a makeup mannequin, it's the least I can do.



She enthusiastically tells me about the stuff she uses.
