Only after a while do I realize that people are watching. 



I hear my voice drowning out everyone else's and realize that my whole body is rocking back and forth. 



Petra beams at me from the front. The teenage girl is smiling too. Filippa smiles back.



When I look around, I realize that everyone is standing still in their place and singing. 



It's almost enough to make me angry with them. I mean, the music is so beautiful.



Petra rehearses the parts with us, over and over again. 



No one believes me when I say I didn't know what a part was. 



They can't know that I've never been to an extracurricular activity in my life. 



My mom needed me after school. I cooked and fixed things, helped the assistants. 



My mom and I watched movies and TV shows. 



We'd argue about who was the smartest or the prettiest, and discuss who must be the killer.



Imagine what you can learn in Bokarp anyway!” I say happily.



The teenage girl bursts out laughing and teasingly pulls one of my dreadlocks.



After a while we sing a slower gospel song called “Amazing Graze”. 



I think it's about someone who has found God. 



The melody is great and as I sing words I don't understand with as much fervor as I can, emotions come.



In the middle of it all, I notice something: Petra has almost stopped singing.
