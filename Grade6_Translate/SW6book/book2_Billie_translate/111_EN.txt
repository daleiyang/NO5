Music from the top list trickles out. I knock again, louder. The music stops.



Teas's annoyed voice: “Go!”



But I was just going to...”



I said go!”



Just then Petra comes up the stairs. “You can't talk to Billie like that,” she shouts. 



Now you can actually open the door.”



A few seconds later the door slides open. A small face becomes visible in the darkness. 



Seconds later, a hand comes out and grabs mine.



Good,” Petra says, and leaves.



There's so much perfume in the pink room that I can't breathe. 



I sit down on Tea's bed. It is perfectly made. 



Mange and Petra think the children should clean their own rooms and make their own beds. 



I have so far thrown on the bedspread just to make them happy, 



and every time I do, I feel like I'm doing something crazy.



Tea has drawn the curtains and turned on the lava lamp and a million string lights. 



A bright spotlight on the desk is aimed at the office chair. 



Next to the lamp is a camera. Tea has curled her hair and put on makeup.



She's wearing a pink cardigan that matches everything else in the pink room perfectly: curtains, rugs, cushions, clothes...



Do you like pink?”



She looks at me seriously. “Yes.”
