It's nice if a child can do well too,” she says.



Mange looks at her questioningly. 



“He doesn't want to make a fool of himself just so I can win.



I don't need things to go well for me,” I say.



You see,” Mange says to Petra.



“But all the children aren't supposed to go out and the two of us are supposed to sit here alone and play.



You go out in Monopoly.”



But maybe the important thing is to do something fun together!”



Petra looks down at her lap. Her silver earring dangles. 



She feels that the cuddle was a failure. Poor Petra, it's not her fault. 



It's everything else. That they never talk to each other.



Shall we not continue?”



Mange shakes the dice. You can see that Petra has tears in her eyes. 



Alvar and Tea look in opposite directions.



We can put on a movie when we're done,” says Petra, trying to sound happy. “One that everyone likes.”



There is no one that everyone likes,” says Tea.



I can't stand it any longer. Not for one more second.



What kind of movies did Casper like?”



A compact silence attacks the room. Petra looks like she's going to throw up. 



Mange's smile has hardened.



He starts fiddling with the cards on the board, arranging them in neat piles. 



My heart is beating so hard that my chest hurts, but I have to keep going.
