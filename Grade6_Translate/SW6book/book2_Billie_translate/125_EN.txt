He drops the pottery on the table. His face changes color.



Was I never to know? What?”



Alvar picks up the pottery and straightens it out. 



I stand there, like an idiot. An idiot that nobody thought to tell anything to.



He is silent. He's still not going to talk about Casper. 



No one is going to talk about Casper. I can see that now. 



That they go around pretending it never happened. 



They go on their outings as if nothing happened. 



Eating their dinners without mentioning his name.



And when Tea doesn't come home at exactly the right time, they think she'll disappear from their lives just like him.



Do you have any pictures of him?”



Alvar sits still for a few seconds before his hand starts moving towards his pocket. 



He flips through his cell phone. Hands it to me. 



A little boy appears on the screen, a little boy laughing and playing in the garden and swimming in the sea in summer. 



The little boy is sitting in his mother's arms. 



He is being hugged by his big sister and big brother, carried by his father. 



Alvar laughs in the pictures like I've never seen him do in real life. 



But he was younger then. And he had a little brother.



What happened?”



Alvar picks up the clay man again. “I have to finish now.”



I feel so sorry for him. Maybe he hasn't said a word about Casper since the funeral.
