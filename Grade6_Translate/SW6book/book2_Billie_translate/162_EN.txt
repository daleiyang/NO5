I don't make myself up.”



Yes, you are! You fucking idiot. I ... hate you!”



She runs out of the paddock, all the way along the long side of the hall, towards the exit. 



All attention has turned to her. All of Bokarp is sitting in the stands.



The referee comes out with a piece of paper saying that I have won the match. 



I write my name with a shaky hand. On equally shaky legs I walk towards the exit.



I find Filippa, locked in the bathroom. Crying can be heard through the door. “Filippa?”



Get out!”



I'm sorry!”



You don't understand anything!”



What am I supposed to understand?”



No answer. The sobbing continues. I ask her to come out so we can talk. 



Just as I'm about to give up, the door opens. 



Filippa steps out, red-faced. 



She holds a fistful of toilet paper in her hand and wipes away her tears while 



as she focuses on me.



You just come here and are so damn cool, from Stockholm and ... 



and you're so self-confident, and so sure of yourself, and do exactly what you want...”



But I'm not...”



Yes, you are! 



Everyone thinks you're awesome because you refused to tell me about Nadine, 



but if I'd done the same, they'd be talking shit for weeks.



They look up to you just because you...” She snorts and pulls snot into her nose.
