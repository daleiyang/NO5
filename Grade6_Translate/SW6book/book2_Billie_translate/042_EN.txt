Some girls look like they're fifteen here too, with makeup and short tops. 



Alvar and I walk through the corridors where there are posters with schoolwork, maps and drawings. 



Everywhere we go, people turn around to look for us. I start to feel like a pop star. 



At home, I'm like anyone else at school. Not one person whispers about me. 



No one thinks I'm that interesting.



Doesn't someone new come along very often?”



Alvar shakes his head as he stops at a door. 



Everyone standing there immediately stops talking to each other.



Who is she?”



The girl who asks is dark with tight jeans and a short jacket.



Billie,” Alvar mutters.



“Billie?”



Yes,” I say. “My mom's favorite artist is Michael Jackson. So I'm named after 'Billie Jean'.”



The girl stifles a giggle, but it doesn't sound mean.



“Okay...”



Is that your real hair?” Another asks.



Who else's would it be?”



The dark one laughs. 



She has a smile that makes you happy, dimples and lots of teeth.



To show that I'm not trying to be cocky, I hold out one of my dreadlocks.
