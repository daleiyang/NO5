There, among the trees, I sing everything I know, songs that me and my mom love, I almost scream until the hard part is over. 



And when I come back inside, my head is not so full anymore. 



I'm going to play ping pong. I'll go home to my new friends. I'm going to eat granola.



Everything would be easier if the atmosphere in the house was more relaxed. 



Sometimes I think that the four of us don't live together, but in separate worlds.



Tea spends most of her time in her room with the door locked, and when she comes out she's wearing a new pink outfit. 



Alvar has his life outside in the little cottage. 



Mange talks in an artificial voice about things that no one else is interested in, and Petra walks around uncontactable



rubbing stains off the white walls, until she suddenly wakes up to say something stern.



And all the time it gets colder. No way I will be able to get used to it.



Petra waters the tiny tree in the garden in the evenings, 



pours on a powder and waters again, pours powder and waters. 



The tree still never seems to want to grow. 



I wonder why she doesn't go in to Alvar in the little cottage. 



Surely it can't be normal to care more about a tree than a person?



On the way to school I pluck up the courage to ask what he does out there in the evenings.
