The train stops at a place I had never heard the name of until I saw it on the ticket. 



All I know for sure is that it is about seven hours from where I live. 



I get off with my heavy bag before Cecilia.



“How's it going, Billie?”



There's really nothing much wrong with Cecilia,



other than the fact that she's been taught in her training that she's needed in my life. 



The problem is that they teach that all so-called children are the same. 



They think I need the same things as other 12-year-olds, 



who go to the country with mom and dad on the weekends and share a bag of chips with three other kids on Friday nights.



I drop my bag with a thud and look around. 



The station consists of an old red brick station house and three train tracks. 



The others who have gotten off disappear towards the parking lot.
