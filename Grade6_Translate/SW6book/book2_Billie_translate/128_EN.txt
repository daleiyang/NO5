I go to Mass on Sunday and listen to what she has to say. 



She talks about seeking comfort in Jesus again. 



I realize now that everything she says has to do with Casper. 



Does everyone else hear the same thing? Yes, everyone must know that the priest lost his child. 



I'm sure they talked about it all the time afterwards. But after a while, they stopped talking. 



In the end, it was almost as if it had never happened. 



I look around the church, at the pensioners in the pews and the golden angels on the ceiling. 



At the front is Jesus. As expected, he doesn't have much to say.



I try to be an even simpler child than before. 



I exclaim that there can be no better place on earth than Bokarp. 



Petra looks at me in wonder. 



Mange frowns worriedly when I offer to wash the pots after dinner. 



They had probably thought that this with me would be a challenge. 



Maybe they are even disappointed.



Mange does a lot of weight training. He is almost more in the hall than at home. 



He tries to get the family to do sports with him, but neither Alvar nor Tea are interested. 



And Petra only goes to yoga. To make him happy, I suggest we go out for a run. 



He is overjoyed. I've only run at the school orientation before.
