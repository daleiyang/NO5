AFTER SCHOOL, EVIN ASKS me to go to her house, but I suspect the Persson family wouldn't appreciate it.



So I run after Alvar instead. 



I ask him a few questions about the class, but I can tell he doesn't want to talk. 



In my body I feel what he feels: 



That it's typical that I make friends in one day when he hasn't made one in five years. 



I agree that it's unfair.



At the same time, how can anyone want to be friends with someone who just looks down?



Coming to someone else's house is not easy. 



I don't know how to behave if I can just throw myself on the couch. 



Almost immediately I get that feeling again, that something is not right. 



I tell myself that maybe it's me that's wrong,



who's lived with a sick, disabled person all my life and never with someone normal.
