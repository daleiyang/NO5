Do you want to come in?”



I nod. Silently I follow him into the cottage.



It's even smaller than I thought; there's really only room for a narrow bunk bed and a small table by the window. 



The table is full of small things in a thousand different colors. 



At first it looks like trash, but after a few seconds I realize that they are little figures made of clay. 



Alvar sits down on the chair.



It's just ... it's just to have something to do.”



I hold out my hand. “May I ...?”



He nods. I pick up one of the small figures. It's a dragon-like bird in battle dress. 



The scales are colorful and full of detail, the beak long and pointed.



And the face. It doesn't exactly put you in a good mood to look at it.



“He doesn't look happy,” I say.



“He's not happy.



Is he really angry?”



Alvar nods.



Is he going to poke my eyes out with his pointy beak?”



Alvar smiles a little and shakes his head.



Good luck,” I say.



I put the bird down and look at the other figures. Some are animals, some are people. 



They look like they're in a war, but they're not ordinary soldiers.
