It's great that God is there for those who want him. Even if there are not many.”



Petra smiles quickly and says that we will soon arrive at their nice square in the center. 



I obediently walk alongside her. 



The few people we meet cheer Petra on and throw a questioning look at me. 



I wonder what they are thinking. That I am a relative perhaps. 



Or some poor soul that Petra is taking care of? That's how it is, after all.



The streets are almost empty, like a suburb on a Sunday or the hottest day of the summer in the city.



It smells completely different from home. It smells like nothing. 



People who live here probably think exhaust fumes are disgusting, but for me it's almost the opposite. 



Exhaust fumes have been a part of my life since I was born, so it feels like something is missing.



The sun has gone into clouds. I am so bored I could die. The road we are walking on is a back street. 



When I think about it, I feel like the whole town is made up of back streets. 



Petra points out the sports hall where they practice table tennis and have competitions. 



“Soon they'll be holding an extra big competition here. People will be traveling from all over the region. 



Petra says it's “the thing of the year”, that everyone in the community gets involved.



Here it is.



I look around in surprise. So this is the 'square'. 



In the center is a metal statue of a girl holding a bouquet of flowers.
