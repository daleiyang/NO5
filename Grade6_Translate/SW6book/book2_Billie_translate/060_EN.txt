TEA IS NOT IN TIME for dinner. 



Her cell phone is off, so Mange and Petra have to call friends and their parents. 



Their voices are getting louder in the kitchen. Alvar and I look at each other. 



It's only a quarter past six, but they act like it's the middle of the night.



'You knew I was going out with Billie,' Petra says to Mange. “Of course I thought you knew.”



Petra turns to me to tell me that Tea is not usually like this. 



She almost always comes home straight after school and if she goes to a friend's they know the day before. 



As if I would care if she was late. 



I've never had an appointment in my life, but Petra can't know that. 



I really don't understand why there's such a drama. What could happen in Bokarp?
