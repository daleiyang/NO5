Why can't you just force everyone who can't get along to move?”



How would you do that?” Petra asked.



With weapons/guns,” I said.



Petra looked at me sternly. “Weapons/Guns don't solve problems, Billie.”



Well, that's clear.



Petra poured more juice into my glass. 



But if you just listen to each other, things usually work out pretty well in life.”



They were so well behaved. No one was reaching across the table, everyone was helping to clear away. 



They can't normally be so polite, I thought. 



Can't the children always get up as if on command and go and brush their teeth just in time for them to get to school?



I glance at Alvar. He is wearing jeans and a plain blue jacket. 



His backpack is firmly attached to his back.



He puts his feet down so gently on the ground. 



His whole body is tense. Wax doesn't seem to be his thing.



His hair lies flat on his head like a helmet. 



The bangs hang way down into his eyes, so he has to throw his head to the side all the time. 



That's kind of cute. 



I don't mean that he's cute for that, 



the tossing just makes me feel better about him being so lame, it's a so-called “mitigating circumstance”.
