The witches



None of the women identified as witches actually went to Blåkulla. 



But some of them actually practiced witchcraft.



Here are some magical items that the court took from Elin Eriksdotter, who was accused of being a witch: 



a chicken foot, a bear claw, a piece of skull, a piece of bone with a face cut into it and a stick with a piece of skin. 



The stick was called a milk hare and was used to steal milk by magic from the neighbor's cows.



Gertrud Svensdotter was 11 years old and used to herd goats by the Dalälven river. 



She once rescued some goats that had wandered onto an islet in the river. 



The 9-year-old Mats had not dared to help.



When they got back to the village, he told the adults that Gertrud had saved the goats using magic.



She had walked on water. The rumor spread. Gertrude had been helped by the Devil!



She was questioned by the vicar and later by the king's bailiff. 



Gertrude was forced to say that she and others were involved in sorcery and witchcraft.



New rumors spread and more children were questioned. Adults were also taken in for questioning and tortured. 



In the end, 29 people were convicted of witchcraft. 



Twelve of them were sentenced to death. Gertrud was spared execution because she confessed and pointed out other witches. 



She had to stand outside the church three Sundays in a row and be shamed. 



She was also beaten with rice. Accusations of witchcraft began to spread in Sweden. 



Many women were pointed out as witches.
