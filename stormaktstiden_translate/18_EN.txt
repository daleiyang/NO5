3. AXIS AND ORDER.
Because Gustav II Adolf was at war so much,
someone else needed to be in charge of Sweden.
That job fell to the nobleman Axel Oxenstierna. 
He was the Chancellor. 
It's like being prime minister, foreign minister and finance minister all at once. 
When the king died in Litzen in 1632, 
Axel had to take over responsibility for Sweden for several years until Gustav Adolf's daughter Kristina came of age.
Axel wanted Sweden to become a modern and well-ordered country. 
Sweden was becoming too big for a king or chancellor to keep track of everything by himself. 
He therefore organized agencies in Stockholm with salaried officials. 
They would handle wars, taxes, laws, courts and trade. 
This gave Axel better control over Sweden. 
He could now know how much tax and how many soldiers the population could contribute. 
In the time of the Great Powers, Sweden constantly needed more money and new soldiers for the wars.
Few nobles.
Many new officials were needed for the new offices.
Only nobles were allowed to have the best jobs. 
But Axel thought that Sweden's nobles were too few and too lazy to do all the new jobs. 
So he made sure that talented miller's sons and other young men from simpler backgrounds were ennobled and could get jobs in the civil service.
Axel was clever. He once organized an important meeting in Germany with nobles from different countries.
They argued about how to sit at the table and who would get the best seats.
Axel got tired of their bickering, took away the chairs and everyone had to stand at the meeting instead!
