People on board

This is what one of the dead on the Vasa ship might have looked like. 
Scientists have figured out how muscle, fat and cartilage were attached to the skeleton.
They then made a model of the face. 
The beard and hair are guesses, but this is what the fashion looked like when Vasa sank. 
The man was found in a storage room far down in the ship.
Next to him was a musket (a rifle) and a lantern. 
Scientists therefore believe that he may have been guarding the storeroom when the ship sank.

Here is the skeleton of one of the drowned. 
Traces on the skeleton show that it was a woman who was 166 cm tall and about 17 years old. 
The skeleton shows that she had eaten poorly and had a disease that made her shaky.
She was wearing leather shoes when she was found. 
In a purse or pocket, she had a key and 26 copper coins worth 31 Ã¶re.
That was enough to buy five chickens. 
She was probably related to one of the men on board and would probably only have traveled a little way out into the archipelago as a guest.

On Vasa, archaeologists found many objects that are traces of people's everyday life.

Wooden water bottle

Here is a tripod pot. You could put it on the fire when you cooked.

Why is the Vasa Ship a good clue?
