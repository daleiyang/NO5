Noblewomen.
Maria Euphrosyne was Queen Christina's cousin.
She was one of the leading noblewomen in Sweden.
A noblewoman had to be brought up to be a good housewife and be able to look after a large household in a manor. 
Noblewomen did not go to school, but they could be taught at home by a teacher. 
There was a lot to learn. 
She would be able to read, write, speak French, be on her best behavior, set beautiful tables, plan feasts, polish silver, supervise the servants, and make sure the large garden was tended. 
She would also learn all the chores that needed to be done in a large household: cooking, brewing beer, baking, washing and keeping the accounts. 
As the nobles were often away at war, the noblewomen had to take responsibility for the whole estate.
The noblewomen who became widows were able to be more independent and take over the businesses their husbands had run, such as mines, mills, shipping companies and factories. 
They could become very good businesswomen.
Why was luxury important to the nobility?
This doll's house dates from the time of the Great Powers. 
It was used to teach noblewomen how a large household worked.
