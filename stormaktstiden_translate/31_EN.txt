Science in Europe.
In the 17th century, science became increasingly important. 
Scientists investigated the world and nature itself instead of relying on what was written in the Bible and old books.
The telescope.
The Italian Galileo Galilei was one of the first to build a telescope. 
It's a telescope that you can use to look into space.
Galileo saw amazing things: the Moon had mountains, Jupiter had moons and the Milky Way was full of stars! 
Galileo became convinced that the Earth revolved around the Sun, as Copernicus had suggested back in the 16th century. 
But the Catholic Church did not like Galileo's views. 
They were not in line with what the Church taught.
So he was locked up in his house for the rest of his life. 
He became blind and died in 1642.
Some noble families were interested in science.
Skokloster has a large collection of telescopes from the 17th century. 
Here you see one of them.
The microscope.
The first real microscopes were built in the 17th century. 
They made it possible to see tiny animals and bacteria. 
Scientists realized that there was much to discover that could not be seen with the naked eye.
Isaac Newton.
Englishman Isaac Newton is considered one of the greatest scientists in history.
He managed to show that an apple falling to the ground and the moon moving around the Earth obey the same law, the law of gravity. 
Using Isaac's mathematical formulas, it was possible to calculate exactly how the planets and the moon would move.
Scientists realized that with the help of mathematics they could find out a lot about how the world works.
Do you think many Swedes cared about the results of Galileo and Newton?
