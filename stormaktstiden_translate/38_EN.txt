The Greycoat and the snappers



During the reign of Charles XI, there was peace for 21 years. It was the longest period of peace in Sweden during the entire period of great power. 



Charles was stingy with the nobility and tried to punish those who took too much tax from the peasants. 



He traveled around Sweden more than any previous king had done. In one day he could ride 10-15 miles. 



On his journeys he inspected royal officials, soldiers and roads. 



Long after Charles XI's death, many legends were told about how he helped farmers and poor priests. 



It was said that he traveled among the people dressed in a simple grey cloak to avoid being recognized. 



That's why he came to be known as the Gray Cloak.



Charles XI was given the horse Brilliant as a gift by the French King Louis XIV. 



War horses were trained hard for battle. They were not allowed to be afraid of gunfire, drums or fire. 



They were trained to kick forward and backward. This was good when the enemy got too close.



This precious flask from Paris was worn by Charles XI at the age of 4 after his father died. 



Charles was raised to be a king. He had an easy time listening and understanding, but a hard time reading and writing. 



He was happiest when he was on horseback practicing war.
