4 CHRISTINA AND THE NOBILITY.
I made up many sayings and wrote them down. 
Here is one: It's easier to go to war than to get married!
“I was completely bald and had a rough and strong voice, which made the midwives think I was a boy.”
This is how Kristina, the daughter of King Gustav Adolf, describes what happened when she was born at Stockholm Castle in 1626. 
The midwives cried out that a boy had been born. 
At last, Sweden had a prince who could inherit the crown! 
But when Kristina was carried to the king, he could see that she was a girl. 
He smiled and said: “She'll get clever in time, because she's fooled us all!”
The King wanted Kristina to be brought up to rule Sweden.
Kristina grows up.
This is the dress Kristina wore when she was 2 years old. 
It is now in the Livrustkammaren museum in Stockholm.
Kristina was only 5 years old when her father died.
Axel Oxenstierna and some other noblemen were allowed to rule Sweden until she became an adult. 
Kristina learned to ride, hunt and shoot. 
She studied history, politics and several languages. 
Kristina was taught together with her cousin King Gustav. 
Already at the age of 13, Kristina was allowed to start helping to govern Sweden.
When she turned 18, she came of age and was allowed to rule the country herself.
Kristina becomes queen.
Kristina became queen of a large but poor country. 
There was a famine in Sweden. 
Crop failures had left people starving and forced to cook food on leaves and twigs. 
But the queen's coronation in 1650 was still to be a great celebration. 
It was important to show the countries of Europe how powerful Sweden was. 
The Queen marched into Stockholm with horses, carriages, soldiers, trumpeters and punchers. 
She traveled along the new, straight Drottninggatan, which had been named after her. 
Cannons fired a salute. Gunpowder smoke lay like a fog over the city. 
The people in the streets were treated to roast oxen and wine flowing from fountains.
