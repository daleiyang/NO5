The Thirty Years' War
Gustavus Adolphus soon embarked on a new war abroad. 
This war was later known as the Thirty Years' War. 
It had already started in 1618 as a war between Protestants and Catholics in Germany. 
But the war was also about the fact that many German minor princes did not want the German emperor to gain too much power. 
The reason why the Swedish king got involved in the war is sometimes said to be that he wanted to defend Protestantism, but it was probably not that simple. 
Gustavus Adolphus was afraid that the Catholic German emperor would threaten Sweden's power over the Baltic Sea. 
Catholic France helped Sweden because the French king did not want the German emperor to gain too much power either. 
In addition, Gustavus Adolphus wanted to gain warlike glory and power. 
He set off for the war with 120 ships and thousands of soldiers.

Here is one of Gustav II Adolf's flyers. 
He is riding a lion. 
The German Emperor rides a sneaky wolf disguised as an innocent sheep.

The lion from the North 

Thunder hung in the air on that hot June day in 1630 when Gustavus Adolphus landed in Germany. 
There were already rumors about him. 
He was compared to a lion. Gustav Adolf took advantage of this. 
He had flyers printed and distributed to the people. 
Flyers were papers with pictures and some text on them. 
They described Gustav Adolf as the Lion of the North, who had come to free the Germans from the terrible Kaiser. 
That's how he got people to like him and join his side in the war.

Why wasn't Gustav II Adolf allowed to marry whoever he wanted?
