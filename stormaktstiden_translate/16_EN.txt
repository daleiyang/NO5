Here's a painting of the Julita mill from the 1640s.

The men worked and slept away all week except Sunday.
The children had to carry food for them.
The women brushed and bathed their husbands when they came home.

The Walloons' homes were together. 
The sons of the Walloons went to school where they were taught by French-speaking priests. 
The schooling was often so good that the boys were able to pursue careers outside the mill as clerks and scribes.

The mill also had gun foundries.
Molten iron was poured into molds and cast into cannons.

The iron was smelted from the ore in the blast furnace. 
A lot of coal was needed for this.
From the age of 12, boys were allowed to help.
For example, they could make coal, crush ore or help in the forge.

Here the gun barrels were drilled.

Various tools and weapons were made in the forge.

The mill owner who ran the mill lived in the manor.
