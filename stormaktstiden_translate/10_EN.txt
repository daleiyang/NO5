2. GUSTAV AND THE WAR

Gustav II Adolf was the first king of the Great Powers. 
When his father Charles IX died in 1611, Gustav Adolf was only 17 years old. 
To become king of Sweden, he had to sign a paper from the nobleman Axel Oxenstierna.

It was a royal pledge in which Gustav Adolf promised to allow the nobility to have a say in many things in Sweden.
The nobles didn't want the new king to be like his angry father, who had decided everything and had several nobles beheaded.

Gustav Adolf did not just inherit the royal crown from his father. 
Sweden was at war with Denmark, Russia and Poland. 
Gustav Adolf had to take over these wars. 
He took part in the wars himself and was wounded several times.
In 1629, Sweden was finally at peace with all its neighbors.

Gustav and love
Gustav II Adolf was a cheerful man, but he was easily angered if people did not do as he said. 
He also fell in love easily. 
He wrote several love letters to the Swedish noblewoman Ebba Brahe. 
Many of them still exist. In one letter, Gustav Adolf writes "A thousand, a thousand good nights my dearest heart - goodbye, goodbye, my heart, my her".
But the king's mother wanted him to marry a foreign princess so that he would have powerful friends. 
Gustav Adolf therefore married the German princess Maria Eleonora.
They did not get on very well. 
She thought that Gustav Adolf worked too much and he used to complain about his wife to Axel Oxenstierna. 
They had a daughter, Kristina, who would one day become Queen of Sweden.
