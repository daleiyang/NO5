The Great Power era has left its mark



Many traces of the Great Powers remain today. 



You can visit castles and other buildings yourself or examine letters and church records in archives. 



But the traces can also be found in language. 



Did you know that it was the children of the aristocracy who first started using the French words mamma and pappa here in Sweden?



Another trace from the time of the Great Powers is a beautiful song printed in a hymnbook in 1695. 



At that time, Sweden suffered a severe famine and many people starved to death. 



The song is a prayer for good growth in the fields and in nature. 



This was more important to most people than all the kings and wars of the age of great power. 



Maybe you recognize it?



The time of flowers now comes with joy and splendor great You approaching sweet summer When grass and crops grow.



Charles XII has been remembered in different ways. 



Some have seen him as a hero and erected statues to him.



Others think he is the one who ended the era of Swedish great power. 



He also caused a lot of suffering among people both abroad and at home in Sweden.
