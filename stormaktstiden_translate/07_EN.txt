Sweden's borders in 1658, when the superpower was at its peak.

Denmark
was often at war with Sweden

Finland
was part of Sweden and was particularly hard hit by wars with Russia.

Poland
Gustavus Adolphus's cousin Sigismund was in Poland and wanted to be king of Sweden. 
This is why Sweden and Poland went to war several times.

Russia

Tsar Peter was over two meters tall and could bend horseshoes with his bare hands. 
He was called the Great Peter.
He wanted to make Russia a modern country and founded cities such as Saint Petersburg. 
Tsar Peter wanted more ports in the Baltic Sea. 
His soldiers conquered Estonia from Sweden in 1710 and eventually ended the Swedish Empire. 

Germany

Germany had a Catholic emperor, but the country was divided into several fairly independent small kingdoms. 
In northern Germany many people were Protestants, in southern Germany many were Catholics. 
They ended up at war with each other. 
Although France was Catholic, the French king helped the German Protestants. 
This was so that the German emperor would not become too strong and threaten France. 
Therefore, Protestant Sweden also received money from France to fight against the German Emperor.


There were about 100 million peasants in Europe.
They were the ones who paid for the wars and luxuries of kings and nobles.

Here is a different portrait of the German Emperor. 
It was taken as spoils of war from Prague and ended up in Skokloster Castle in Sweden

Turkey

was called the Ottoman Empire. Most people there were Muslim.
