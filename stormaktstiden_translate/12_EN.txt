The painting shows the battle between the soldiers of Gustav II Adolf and the German Emperor at the village of Breitenfeld in Germany. 
The battle began at noon on September 7, 1631.

The Swedish army was well trained and could move quickly in small groups on the battlefield. 
Only one fifth of the soldiers were Swedish. 
The rest were mercenaries hired by the king. 
The battle began with soldiers on both sides firing at each other with cannons. 
Then the Emperor's horsemen tired themselves out with several unsuccessful attacks with drawn pistols and sabres against the Swedes. 
Finally, the Swedes attacked the Emperor's soldiers and won. 
By then the battle had lasted seven hours. 12000 people lost their lives. 
It was the biggest battle in Europe for over a hundred years.
Word of the Swedish king's victory spread. 
Gustav Adolf continued to fight south in Germany. 
But a year later, he was killed at the Battle of Litzen. 
The nobleman Axel Oxenstierna took over the rule of Sweden. 
He continued the war because he did not want Sweden to lose. 
Peace did not come until 1648. By then the war in Europe had lasted 30 years. 
This is why it is called the Thirty Years' War. 

Most of the fighting in the Thirty Years' War took place in Germany. 
The war was messy. On the map you can see how Peter the mercenary traveled around.
