The post office.
The Post Office was founded in the early 17th century. 
Previously, letters had to be sent by someone who happened to be traveling in the right direction. 
This took a long time and was unsafe.
Now, post offices were opened in towns with a postmaster who took care of the letters and postilions who delivered them.
Postmasters were usually men, but their widows could take over their work. 
The widow Gese Wechsel was the postmistress of the Kingdom of Sweden, i.e. the head of the country's entire postal service for several years.
Postilions were scattered around the country and were often farmers. 
They would be no more than three miles apart.
postilions ran or rode with the letters.
Whatever the weather, he would cover a mile in a couple of hours. 
When a postillion approached the next postillion, he would blow his post horn so that the other could get ready. 
Sending a letter from Stockholm to Gothenburg cost as much as a miner's daily wage and took just over a week.
The newspaper.
Axel Oxenstierna wanted to spread news about how the war was going and other events. 
He therefore had Sweden's first newspaper, Ordinary Post News (Tijdender = news), printed. 
It was published by the postmaster in Stockholm once a week and contained mostly war news.
In issue 4 from 1645, you could read that the field marshal (a high military officer) 
Gustav Horn was with his troops in Danish Skåne, that they had quite a lot to eat and that a drummer had been sent to Malmö to buy some things. 
The newspaper is the oldest newspaper in the world that is still published. 
Nowadays it is called Post-och Inrikes tidningar and is available online. 
Why were good roads important?
