Sweden and the world

Several European countries had set up colonies in other parts of the world to make money by trading goods from there. 
For example, North American colonies grew tobacco that could be sold in Europe. 
The nobleman Axel Oxenstierna wanted Sweden to have a colony on the east coast of North America. 
In 1638, two ships sailed over with soldiers. 
They founded a Swedish colony, New Sweden. 
A fort was built there and named Fort Christina after the Queen of Sweden.

Per Lindeström traveled on the same ship as Margareta.
He wrote and drew a book about the voyage and New Sweden.
Here he has drawn an Indian family.

In February 1654, Margareta Eskilsdotter boarded the ship Örnen in Gothenburg together with her parents and younger brothers. 
They were traveling to America.
They had everything they owned with them in chests and bundles. 
Seamen, soldiers, craftsmen, farmers and children crowded on board.
In total, there were 350 people.

It was a bitterly cold winter with stormy winds and ice floes when the ship set sail. 
Further south, it became so warm that disease broke out on board. 
People were huddled together on deck in the sunshine, their clothes full of lice and fleas. 
Despite catching flying fish, dolphins and crabs, food became scarce. 
The drinking water rotted and smelled like the 'worst of the worst'. 
Margaret's parents died during the journey and were thrown into the sea.
After 107 days, the Eagle arrived in the Swedish colony of New Sweden on the Delaware River. 
A third of the crew died on board. 
Margareta had to take care of her younger brothers in the new country. 
She never had a family of her own.

Swedish noble families collected exciting objects from other continents. 
This is a mallet from the Indians in New Sweden. 
It has been kept at Skokloster Castle.
