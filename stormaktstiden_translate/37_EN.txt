Charles X Gustav was already dead.



Ulrika Eleonora the Elder from Denmark was married to Charles XI. 



She had to play cards with her mother-in-law.



Ulrika Eleonora the Younger was the sister of Charles XII.



She became queen at the end of the Great Power era.



The Carolinian period



The latter part of the Great Power period (1654-1718) is known as the Carolingian period. 



Three kings in a row were named Charles: Charles X Gustav, Charles XI and Charles XII. 



They were father, son and grandson.



Charles X Gustav needed more power, taxes and soldiers to keep fighting and defending Sweden. 



To get this, he thought major changes were needed in the way Sweden was governed. 



He had several ideas about how to do this. 



But as he died after only a few years, it was his son and grandson who implemented many of these ideas. 



The three most important changes during the Carolinian period were



The autocracy. The king took the power to decide almost everything in the kingdom. 



He obeyed only God. 



The council, the nobility and the Riksdag were no longer allowed to participate in decision-making as much.



The division system. Sweden's peasants were divided into rotes, small groups. 



The peasants in each rota were to equip and support a soldier who was given his own small croft. 



Now the king only had to call up the soldiers who were ready when war broke out, instead of drafting peasants.



The reduction. In order to be able to afford to introduce the division system, the king took back many farms 



and land from the nobility that King Gustav II Adolf and Queen Kristina had given them. 



The king himself needed the taxes from the farms to pay for Sweden's defence and wars. 



One of the people who lost the most from the reduction was the rich nobleman Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie. 



How do you think the nobles felt about the reduction?
