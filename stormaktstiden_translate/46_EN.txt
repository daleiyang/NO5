The end of the Great Powers



After returning from Turkey, Charles XII attacked Norway with his Carolinians. He wanted to conquer Norway. 



On the evening of November 30, 1718, Charles stood in a trench and looked up at the Norwegian fortress Fredriksten. 



He could hear the Norwegians firing from the fortress.



Suddenly, some soldiers near the king heard a noise, like the sound of two fingers striking a palm. 



The king shuddered. He sank down with his head on the edge of the trench. 



A shot had gone straight through the king's head. Charles XII was dead!



Russia attacks



When the Russian Tsar Peter heard that Charles XII had died, he attacked Sweden. 



He had already conquered Estonia and now his soldiers were burning and ravaging the east coast of Sweden. 



It's called the Russian ravages. A few thousand Russian soldiers went ashore to conquer Stockholm.



They were stopped just a few miles from the capital.



The end of the Great Pact



Sweden escaped a Russian conquest. 



But with the death of Charles XII, Sweden's era of great power was over. 



The Great Northern War had left Sweden impoverished. Estonia was lost. 



Many thousands of people had fled across the Baltic Sea from Finland and Estonia because the Russians were ravaging them. 



With the refugees came the last great plague epidemic to Sweden. 



The plague hit Stockholm particularly hard. Around 100 000 people died in the whole country.



Norwegian or Swedish bullet?



Soon rumors began to circulate that the king had been murdered by a Swede. 



Surely the great warrior king could not have been killed by an ordinary Norwegian bullet in the dark of night? 



Since then, historians have debated for years where the shot actually came from. 



In 1917, Karl's coffin was opened to examine the bullet holes in his skull. 



Today, most people believe that it was a Norwegian bullet that killed the king.
