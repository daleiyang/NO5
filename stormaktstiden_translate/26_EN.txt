The Sami and silver.
The Sami in northern Sweden were not as settled as the farmers in southern Sweden. 
The Sami could hunt, fish, keep reindeer and move around. 
Axel Oxenstierna and the Church wanted better control over the Sami. 
Then they could get more taxes from them. 
The priests were concerned that many Sami were not yet Christians. 
The Sami had their own religion with many different gods. 
Many of the Sami went to church when they visited farming villages and trading posts. 
But as soon as they returned home, they continued to worship their old gods. 
The priests didn't like that.
This is an old Sami drum painted with gods and other figures.
The priest and Lars.
The priests sometimes used cruel methods to Christianize the Sami. 
In 1692, a priest sent seven men to the Sami Lars in Pite Lapland, to warn him against playing with their old gods. 
They found Lars by a jokk (river), where they heard him “singing and howling rather badly” and playing his drum. 
The drum was used by the Sami to contact the spirit world. 
Lars' 6-year-old grandson had drowned in the jok. 
Lars tried to bring him back to life with the help of the drum. 
But the visitors took the drum out of his hands. 
He got upset and shouted at them. 
Lars was taken to court, but he said he would continue to pray to his old gods as long as he lived. 
He was sentenced to death and burned alive at the stake along with his drum.
It was only after the end of the Great Power era that most Sami became Christians.
