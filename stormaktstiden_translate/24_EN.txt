The land of the war widows.
Gunilla, a farmer's wife, lived in the village of Andersvattnet north of Umeå.
Her family was hit hard by the wars in Europe. 
In 1626, her husband Jöns was sent away as a soldier. 
He died after a few months. 
Gunilla had to take care of their four small children and Jöns' mother and blind father.
The oldest son Per was 10 years old and could help at home. 
Ten years later, he was also sent off to war along with 26 other local farm boys. 
Four months later, all but one were dead. Per was one of them. 
The women did their own regular chores as well as what the men used to do on the farm. 
This could be plowing, taking care of the horses and repairing the house. 
The war led to such a shortage of men in Sweden that there were three times as many unmarried women as unmarried men.
church books.
In the 17th century, priests started to record everyone in the parish who was baptized, married and died in church books. 
Called church records, this made it easier to keep track of the people of the country. 
For example, it was possible to see how many men could be sent to war as soldiers from each parish.
The priest and the peasants.
The priests read out the king's decisions in the parish church and had to make sure that the peasants did what the king wanted. 
But the priests were often the sons of farmers and had friends among the peasants.
So they could sometimes try to help the peasants. 
For example, they could cheat a little with the church records, so that not too many boys would be sent out as soldiers. 
If the priest knew in advance when the bailiff was coming to collect taxes, he could warn the peasants so that they could hide their animals in the forest.
The priest and his assistant, the bell ringer, also taught women and children to read. 
They in turn taught others to read. 
Things went so well that most farmers in Sweden could read by the beginning of the 18th century. 
This is much earlier than in many other European countries.
