Carolingians



The division system of the Carolingian period was designed to make it easier to produce professional soldiers. 



Farmers were divided into rotaries (groups) with 2-5 farms in each. 



Each rota was to support one soldier. 



The soldier was given a croft for his family and help with hay and firewood. 



This meant that farmers and their sons did not have to go to war themselves.



No crazy soldiers!



The men selected as soldiers by the peasants in the root area were gathered for large musters. 



At the muster they were checked and entered on lists. 



The king was often present and approved the soldiers. If a man was not suitable, the king crossed out his name.



Sometimes he wrote “The man is mad - discarded”. 



The soldiers in Charles XII's army are called Carolinians. 



A Carolinian had to be fearless, faithful, sober, a good comrade and able to sing songs and tell stories. 



The selected soldiers were trained to march and shoot.



As many soldiers had the same name, the soldiers took on surnames such as Funny, Sharp, Brave and Goose.



The whole family used to live in one room in the soldiers' tent.



With many children, it got crowded.

On his back he had a knapsack.
