Snapphanes



Skåne had belonged to Sweden since the Peace of Roskilde in 1658, but the people of Skåne felt like Danes. 



The Danish king tried to take back Skåne and some Scanian farmers helped him against the Swedes. 



The Scanians who fought against the Swedes were called snapphanes. 



The Danes saw them as freedom fighters while the Swedes saw them as robbers. 



The Snapphanes and the farmers who supported them could be cruelly punished by the Swedes. 



Farms were burned and livestock confiscated, so that the farmers starved. 



Charles XI ordered that all men between the ages of 15 and 60 in a parish should be shot. 



The captured farmer's son Hans Severin was impaled alive on a stake. 



Executed snapphanes were posted along the roads of Skåne as a warning.



The Loshult heist



In 1996, a soccer team found some large copper coins in a forest plantation near Loshult in northern Skåne. 



The coins probably came from the Loshult coup in 1676. 



At that time, farmers and snapphanes stole the war chest for the Swedes when they transported it through Skåne. 



The war chest consisted of thousands of large copper coins stored in wooden barrels loaded on 250 carts.



At the time, the war chest was worth as much as SEK 100 million today. 



It is said that a large part of the treasure is still buried in the forests of Skåne.



This is one of the coins found from the Loshult coup.



Karl XI wanted the people of Skåne to become Swedes. 



He had a Swedish ABC book printed and distributed in Skåne. 



The Scanian priests were given strict orders to sing and speak only in Swedish in church. 



By the end of the Great Power era, the people of Skåne had stopped resisting.



What do you think the people of Skåne thought of Charles XI?
