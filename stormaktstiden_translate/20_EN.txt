Roads, mail and newspapers.
Axel Oxenstierna understood that a lot had to be done to make the great power of Sweden work well. 
One of the most important things was to improve the roads so that wagons and soldiers could move easily through the country and between cities. 
Before, roads were almost exclusively paths. 
Along the roads, inns were opened where travelers could eat and sleep. 
They could also trade for rested horses. 
Farmers living along the road had to help drive travelers. 
The war meant that there was a shortage of boys and men. 
Often it was girls from the age of 12 and up who had to push people around. 
In Sweden, this was so common that no one thought about it.
But for the foreign travelers it was unusual. 
They were so surprised and impressed that girls were coachmen that they wrote about it. 
Travelers also wrote about their journeys in many other ways.
A Frenchman on a journey.
In 1634, the Frenchman Charles Ogier traveled to Sweden. 
He wrote about his journey in a diary.
As Sweden had long coasts, it was practical to travel by ship. 
But the ship Charles was traveling on was hit by a storm. 
He thought he and his companions would die. 
He wrote that they “threw up so violently, that at last we vomited blood, crawling on deck like quadrupeds.”
Once ashore, they rode horses. In winter Charles went sledging. 
He writes: “It is delightful to glide along the smooth surface of the lakes under the starry sky. 
... It sometimes happens that the sledge tips over, but it is almost without danger. 
On the contrary, you just laugh as you roll around in the snowdrifts.”
