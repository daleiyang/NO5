5. THE CAROLINIAN ERA



After Queen Christina abdicated, her cousin became King of Sweden: Charles X Gustav. 



He had fought in the Thirty Years' War and was a skilled warrior. 



As king, he started new wars to make Sweden an even greater power.



When Charles Gustav fought against Denmark, he was lucky with the weather.



The winter of 1658 was cold. Ice lay between the Danish islands. 



The king marched across the ice with horses and thousands of soldiers.



The ice creaked and cracked. The soldiers carried planks that they laid over the cracks in the ice. 



Sometimes horses and people broke through the ice and disappeared into the depths. 



The king was tucked into a sledge and did well.



The Swedes' march across the ice is known as the 'train across the Great Belt'. 



The Danes had not expected the Swedes to venture across the ice so quickly.



The Danes were defeated by the Swedes.



The victory meant that Sweden gained parts of both Norway and Denmark at the Peace of Roskilde the same year. 



Sk√•ne, Halland and Blekinge now belonged to Sweden.



The kingdom became larger than ever before. 



From now on, Sweden's wars were mostly about defending the empire.



Here is the royal family in 1683.



The only member of the royal family who was around for most of the Carolingian period was Queen Hedvig Eleonora. 



She was from Germany and married to Karl X Gustav. 



However, she became queen dowager at the age of 24 when Charles Gustav died.



Queen Dowager Hedvig Eleonora' helped to rule Sweden. 



She had Drottningholm Palace built.
