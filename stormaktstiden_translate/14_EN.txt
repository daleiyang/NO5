The ship Vasa

Here is a list of discharged Swedish peasant boys from Kainuu parish in Finland who were forced into wartime Europe. 
To the right is their age. The youngest are only 15 years old. 
Many of them never came home again. 
Most of them died of diarrhea and other diseases while in the field camps. 
Only some died in battle.
Thousands of soldiers had to be transported to the wars on the other side of the Baltic Sea. 
Gustavus Adolphus therefore ordered several large ships, which would also be used in battles at sea. 
One of the largest ships was built at a shipyard in Stockholm.
It was 69 meters long and had room for 145 sailors, 300 soldiers and 64 cannons. 
A thousand oaks were used to build it. The ship's name was Vasa.

The Vasa sinks!
On Sunday, August 10, 1628, Stockholmers, foreign diplomats and guests lined the shores to watch the great new ship sail out into the Baltic Sea. 
Vasa's sails were hoisted and the ship's cannons fired a salute. Flags fluttered in the wind. 
But after only a few minutes, a gust of wind caused Vasa to capsize. 
Water rushed into the open gun ports. Vasa sank. 
The ship had been built too high and lanky. 
There were only 150 people on board.
A quarter of them drowned.
Eventually, the ship was forgotten. 
But 333 years later it was raised and put in a museum. 
Wreck specialist Anders Franzen had read about the Vasa in old papers and managed to find the ship at the bottom
The Vasa ship is a fantastic trace from the era of great power.
