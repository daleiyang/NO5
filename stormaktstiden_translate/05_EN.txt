In Sweden, the period between 1611 and 1720 is known as the Great Power period. 
At that time, Sweden had great power in Europe and fought wars for land. 
Neither before nor since has Sweden been so large.

King Gustav II Adolf, who died at LÃ¤tzen, was the king of Sweden at the beginning of the Great Power era. 
He was succeeded by the nobleman Axel Oxenstierna, Queen Christina and the kings Charles X Gustav, Charles XI and Charles XII. 
Their wars to build and maintain power affected the people of Sweden in many ways.
Towards the end of the Great Power period, the wars went badly and Sweden lost land that it had previously conquered.
