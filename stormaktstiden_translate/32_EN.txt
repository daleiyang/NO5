Noble families and castles.
Most of the people at Christina's court were Swedish noblewomen and noblemen. 
The Queen's favorite was Count Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie.
He was the son of Ebba Brahe, with whom Kristina's father had once been in love. 
Magnus Gabriel lived on the taxes he received from the more than a thousand farms he owned around the Baltic Sea. 
He also received many gifts from Kristina. 
Magnus Gabriel boasted that he was the one who introduced luxury to Sweden. 
He and his wife Maria Euphrosyne had many manor houses and noble castles built and restored, which can still be visited today. 
Their finest castle was Läckö in Västergötland.
At the end of the Great Power era, the architect Erik Dahlberg designed Läckö and several other of Sweden's finest manors and castles. 
He added to the pictures with towers and details that did not always exist in reality.
This is how Läckö Castle looks today. 
The nobility built many fine mansions around Sweden during the time of the Great Powers. 
They were built according to the latest European fashions and were often filled with works of art and paintings.
