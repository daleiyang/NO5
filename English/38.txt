Lee’s wish list. It's enormous!

All right, Lee? What are you doing?

Not much. I’m looking at my calendar.

Anything exciting planned?

History test on Thursday, and it’s my birthday on the 23.

That’s next week. Have you gota wish list?

Kind of. I want a snake, but Mum says we can’t afford it. 

I also asked for a mobile.

You owna mobile, don’t you? I thought I saw you with one.

I borrow my dad’s old mobile.

It’s enormous, like a prick.

That’s true. Anyway, I can’t download MP3s. 

In fact, it doesn’t even have a colour screen.

That’s ridiculous!

Yeah, right. I can’t play games without a decent screen.

Haven't you got any video games on your list?

Of course. I'm thirteen, so I’m allowed to play World of Warcraft.

Fingers crossed, then.
