Not even a crumb. 

And Tveno memory whatsoever of the 100-metre sprint after lunch.

I can't even remember if I competed.

When the 50-metre front crawl came I was in a slightly better mood. 

Mrs Atkins called my name. 

I walked slowly to my lane and waited for my opponents to take their places. 

And then my jaw dropped. In the next lane was "irritating" Mary. 

She looked at me with a smug smile on her face. I knew what to do. 

What I actually did was to come second. 

It was a tight finish, but there was an important factor that gave her the victory: 

I was starving. My packed lunch was in my bag, not in my stomach.

I simply had no energy for the last few metres.

First her team beat us at netball, then she thrashed me at table tennis, 

and now this. What an insult!

She turned to me, stretched out her hand to shake mine,

and said "We meet again! See you at swimming practice?”

I never ever want to see her face or hear her voice again. Ever.
