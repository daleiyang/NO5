Hollo, boys! Hollo, boys! God save the Queen.
How did this lead to Bonfire Night?
On the same day the plot was stopped, 
people lit bonfires to celebrate the fact that the King was not killed. 
Since then, people have celebrated Bonfire Night on November 5th.
How do the British celebrate Bonfire Night?
People make a dummy or doll of Guy Fawkes, which is called 'the guy'. 
Some children take their guys out on the streets and ask for money. 
"A penny for the guy!" they shout. 
They use this money to buy fireworks.
On Bonfire Night, they put the guy on top of the bonfire and burn him.
What about fireworks?
Fireworks are, of course, an important part of Bonfire Night. 
Some places like Lewes in East Sussex in England have huge firework displays. 
Smaller children usually have sparklers.
What is typical Bonfire Night food?
Typical food includes soup, baked potatoes (you can bake these in the bonfire if you like) and toffee apples.
