Remember, remember the fifth of November,

Gunpowder, treason and plot.

We see no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot!

Guy Fawkes and Bonfire Night.

What is this famous nursery rhyme all about? 

The nursery rhyme refers to The Gunpowder Plot. 

This is when thirteen young men tried to blow up the Houses of Parliament on November 5th 1605.

Why did they want to do this?

It had to do with religion.

Queen Elizabeth I was a Protestant and she did not treat the Catholics very well. 

When she died, the Catholics in England hoped that the new king would be kinder; 

but he wasn't. what happened then?

Well, a man called Robert Catesby decided to get a small group of men together to kill the King. 

They decided to do this by blowing up the Houses of Parliament with gunpowder.

Were they successful? No, they weren't. 

The King found out about the plot and sent his soldiers to stop it.

Why is Guy Fawkes so famous?

The soldiers found Guy Fawkes under Parliament with 36 barrels of gunpowder in the early hours of 5th November. 

He was later killed because of his treason.
