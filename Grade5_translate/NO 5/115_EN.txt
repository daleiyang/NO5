Great natural resources.
The deep forests have long been used by humans.
In the forest there is wood for firewood and buildings.
People have hunted, picked berries and grazed animals.
Today, a lot of forest is cut down and new ones are planted.
The old forests near the mountains, which were previously not cut down, are now disappearing at an ever faster rate.
Man can use the nature of the mountains in several ways.
To obtain minerals and ore, mines are built.
To get energy, hydro and wind turbines are built.
But the expansions affect nature in several ways.
Damming and controlling the water flows destroys the natural rivers.
The wind turbines can be perceived as disturbing and involve road and pipeline construction.
The beautiful nature of the mountains also attracts many visitors.
Many people come here to hike, ski, hunt, fish or pick berries.
But more tourism means more roads, house building and traffic.
It changes and divides the mountain land.
The rumbling of four-wheelers, scooters and helicopters is now a common sound in the mountain areas.
Threats of the future.
The nature of the mountains is sensitive and changes can lead to the extinction of species.
It is important to examine carefully which interventions can be made in the mountains,
without affecting nature too much.
Some parts of the mountains are protected through nature reserves or national parks.
Then there are rules for what is allowed and forbidden to do.
It is a way of preserving nature for the future.
The fact that the climate is changing also affects the mountains.
A warmer climate causes the tree line on the mountain to move up.
Then trees can manage at higher altitudes, and at the same time, the kalfjället (bare mountain?) disappears more and more.
If the area of the kalfjället (bare mountain?)  shrinks, the number of species there will decrease.
