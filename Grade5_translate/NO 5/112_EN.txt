higher up the mountain.
Trees need soil to get a hold with their roots and to be able to stand firmly when the wind blows hard.
Higher up on the mountain, the tall firs cannot grow, but the smaller mountain birches do just fine.
This is where the mountain birch forest can spread out.
It also gets colder the higher up you go.
For every hundred meters you climb, it gets about one degree colder.
It might not sound like much, but if it's also windy, it's tough to survive.
The air becomes thinner and it becomes more difficult to retain heat.
In the mountain birch forest, the birches grow slowly.
Instead of being tall, they become small and crooked.
It is a protection against the winds, which would easily topple the trees if they were too tall.
The mountain birches are also stretchable and resistant to snow drifts that press on.
If the stem were to break, new shoots will shoot up.
In the mountain birch forest you can find primeval forest, forest that has never been felled.
Part of the mountain birch forest is a nature reserve to protect nature from clear-cutting and development.
On the ground, rice grows from, among other things, blueberries and crowberries.
Together with willow bushes and the small gnarled mountain birches, the rice makes it difficult to get through the forest.
In the forest you can hear a ghostly laugh. It's willow grouse.
Willow grouse. The norway lemming is an important animal in the mountains.
It becomes food for many others. In years when lemmings are scarce, the arctic fox's young do not survive and the barn owl lays no eggs.
Arrows show how the nutrient progresses in the food chain.
The lemming eats everything from mosses to grass that gives it energy to grow.
Both the mountain fox and the mountain owl get the nutrition in the lemming's meat when they eat a lemming.
In this way, the nutrition continues.
