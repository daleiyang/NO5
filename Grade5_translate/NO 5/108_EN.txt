Living in the mountains.
A quarter of Sweden's surface is mountain landscape.
Surviving in the mountains is difficult.
The snow stays for a long time, summer is short and winter is long.
It is windy and cold.
You can see how nature changes when you hike up the mountain.
At the bottom is the coniferous forest close to the mountains.
Where the conifers cannot grow, the mountain birch forest takes over.
The higher you go on the mountain, the harsher the climate becomes.
At the top of the Kalfj√§llet (bare mountain?), it can be very windy.
It is rocky there and the soil layer is very thin.
These different areas are called plant zones.
The plants and animals found in a certain zone have characteristics or behaviors that allow them to live there.
This is called adaptation.
Mountain birch forest. The strong wind and the thin soil layer mean that the mountain birches are short, strong and gnarled.
Small short bushes grow densely and are difficult to get through.
Coniferous forest near the mountains. The tall firs of the forest can become very old.
In winter, many animals retreat from the mountains to seek shelter in the forests.
In order for a tree to get a good hold with its roots and stand firmly when it is windy, a layer of soil is required.
The higher up the mountain you go, the thinner the soil layer becomes.
At the top, the mountain is cold. No trees can grow there.
