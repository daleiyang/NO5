human impact.
The climate of the world can change for several reasons.
The way the earth tilts and rotates around the sun causes it to be different hot or cold.
The brightness of the sun and volcanic eruptions also affect the climate.
but man has also caused a change.
Our energy use plays a major role and affects the environment in several ways.
We cannot prevent volcanoes from erupting - but we can influence what we do ourselves.
greenhouse effect.
around the earth there is an atmosphere of gases that lets in the sun's light and heat, but prevents the heat from radiating back out.
it is called the greenhouse effect.
the atmosphere is a protective envelope.
without it, the heat energy would disappear straight into space and the earth would be so cold that nothing could live here.
carbon dioxide is a gas found in the atmosphere.
It is the same gas that we breathe out, and it is also formed when we burn fossil fuels, such as oil and coal.
The more fossil fuels we use, the more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases.
then even less solar heat will radiate.
This means that the greenhouse effect is strengthened and the earth's climate is getting warmer.
Although that may sound nice to us who live far up north, it leads to big problems.
increasing temperatures cause deserts to expand, polar ice caps to melt and sea levels to rise and lead to floods.
