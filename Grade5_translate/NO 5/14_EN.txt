Shake the bottle with oil and vinegar and you will get a mixture.
Mixtures.
When different substances exist together without forming any new substance, it is called a mixture.
There are several different ways to separate the substances in a mixture.
Air is a mixture of gases, even if you can't see it with the naked eye.
The air contains, among other things, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and oxygen.
Salad dressing is also a mixture.
You can easily see that mixture if you let the dressing stand for a while.
It often consists of cooking oil and vinegar, which are added in layers.
The oil floats on top and the vinegar lies below it.
Before putting the dressing on the salad, shake the bottle well.
Then you shake the oil into small drops that mix with the vinegar.
But after a while the oil floats up and settles at the top again.
Alloys.
Many metals are soft and malleable, while others are brittle and difficult to form.
If you mix metals, you can produce substances with properties that are better suited for what you want to do.
Bronze, for example, is a mixture of copper and tin.
Both copper and pewter are soft, but the alloy bronze is harder.
If you mix a metal with another metal or another substance, it is called an alloy.
The most common way to get an alloy is to fuse the substances together.
Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc.
Many wind instruments are made of brass, because it conducts sound very well.
Steel, which is a common and useful material, is an alloy of iron and carbon.
