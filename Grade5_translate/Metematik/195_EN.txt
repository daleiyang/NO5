DIVISION OF POSITIVE INTEGER NUMBERS.
Even when a positive integer is divided by 10, the digits in the number will get a 10 times smaller value.
The division 75/10 can be shown like this:
hundreds. ten. singular. tenth. hundredth.
When we divide by 10, the number 7 moves from the tens position to the ones position.
The number 5 moves from the ones position to the tenths position.
We write 75 as 75.0 to make the decimal point visible.
Similarly, we can show that 75/100 = 0.75 and that 75/1000 = 0.075.
You can think like this: "It looks like the decimal point moves one step to the left."
You move the decimal point as many steps as there are zeros in 10.
You can think like this: "It looks like the decimal point moves two steps to the left."
You move the decimal point as many steps as there are zeros in 100.
Since the decimal point then ends up in front of the 3, you must print a zero in place of the first digit.
You can think like this: "It looks like the decimal point moves three steps to the left."
You move the decimal point as many steps as there are zeros in 1000.
Here you need to print two extra zeros to be able to put out the decimal point.
