Different nature types in Eastern Europe.
In Eastern Europe there are several different nature types.
The tundra. The tundra lies in the farthest north.
It is an area where it is cold all year round.
In summer, the ground only thaws on the surface.
But a little way down, the ground is always frozen.
It is called permafrost, which means permanent frost.
On the tundra, only mosses, lichens and grass thrive.
The Taiga. South of the tundra is a large coniferous forest area known as the taiga.
TThe taiga extends over a large part of Russia and continues further into Finland and Sweden.
Coniferous trees such as spruce, pine and larch grow in the taiga.
Deciduous forest. South of the taiga there is deciduous forest.
There grow trees that have green leaves,
but the leaves of deciduous trees wither and fall to the ground in autumn.
Because the soil where the deciduous forest grows is fertile, people have often cleared the forest.
Instead, there are large fields and pastures here today.
The steppe. South of the deciduous forest belt lies the steppe.
A steppe is a large and dry grassy plain,
where, in addition to grass, some bushes grow.
On the steppe, only a little rain falls,
which causes the grass to wither down easily.
With the help of artificial irrigation, people have managed to get arable land on the steppe.
