These countries also have large cities with several million inhabitants. 
Such cities include London, Paris, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Hamburg, Berlin and Rome.
The two Russian cities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg are also multi-million dollar cities.
The map also shows that northern Europe, where the Nordic countries are located, is sparsely populated. 
Some areas in southern Europe are also not very densely populated.
The population of Europe is declining.

This is mostly because we have become healthier and are living longer.
But now the population has stopped growing and in some countries it is declining.
This is mostly because we are not having as many children anymore. 
But it's also because many young people in Eastern Europe are moving abroad to study or look for work.
