Eastern Europe.
Russia and Turkey are located on two continents.
In the region we call Eastern Europe are the countries Russia,
Belarus, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria and Moldova.
Eastern Europe also usually includes the small part of Turkey, which does not belong to Asia.
Russia is the world's largest country.
Russia stretches across the two continents of Europe and Asia.
The border runs along the Ural mountain range.
Therefore, only a quarter of Russia's total area is in Europe.
In southern Russia and east of the Black Sea lies another mountain range called the Caucasus.
This mountain range forms another continent's border between Europe and Asia.
In the Caucasus is the mountain peak Elbrus (5642 m),
which is usually considered Europe's highest mountain.
