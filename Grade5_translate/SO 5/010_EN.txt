Continental drift. 
About 250 million years ago, all of the Earth's continental plates came together in one giant supercontinent.
It is called Pangea.
There were probably several supercontinents even earlier in Earth's history.
North America. Europe Asia South America Africa India Antarctica Australia.
Pangea - the world 250 million years ago.
But 200 million years ago, the supercontinent broke into pieces. 
The pieces began to slide away from each other.
North America slid to the northwest and Africa to the northeast. 
Between the two pieces, the Atlantic Ocean was formed.
India, which was attached to Africa, broke off and slid to the northeast.
Australia, attached to Antarctica, broke away and became its own continent.
The world 135 million years ago.
Millions of years passed and the plates kept moving. 
Eventually, India collided with Asia. 
This powerful collision created the world's highest mountain range, the Himalayas.
Similarly, the Alps were formed when Africa collided with Europe. 
The movement of the different plates in this way is known as continental drift.
This is what the world looks like today.
The continental plates continue to move. 
In the future, 25 million years from now, North and South America will have moved further and further west. 
It is also thought that North and South America will drift apart, and that Australia will merge with Asia.
In another 250 million years, a new supercontinent like Pangea is thought to have formed.
