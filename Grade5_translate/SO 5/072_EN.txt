Lots of lowland in western Europe.
Most of Western Europe is lowland.
The land that is not built on by towns and communities usually consists of cultivated land and pasture.
But a large part of Europe's agricultural products also come from the various countries in Western Europe.
Also some mountains and highlands.
Western Europe is large on the surface. Some of the countries are so large that nature becomes very varied.
The great mountain range of the Alps runs through both France and Germany.
The Alps are Europe's largest mountain range with peaks over 4,000 meters.
In France there is also the high plateau Massif Central and towards the border with Spain the great mountain chain the Pyrenees.
Some areas in Western Europe have more rounded mountain areas, which are often covered with forest.
In Great Britain are the Pennines, in Germany the Harz and Black Forest, while the Ardennes are in Belgium.
The rivers - busy waterways.
Through Western Europe, several large rivers flow calmly and quietly. These rivers are excellent for transporting goods.
Therefore, cargo boats and barges are common on the Rhine, Mosel and Elbe rivers in Germany, the Seine and Rhone in France and the Thames in England.
The Netherlands is a typical low country and at the same time a large agricultural country.
Black Forest - a mountain area in southern Germany. Moselle valley.
Europe's first industries.
The countries of Western Europe became the first industrialized countries in the world.
The very first factories were located in Great Britain.
Then industrialization spread further to the other countries.
The first factories were textile industries and engineering industries.
As the factories needed labor, people moved to the industrial towns, which grew into large cities.
Even today, the industries provide large incomes to the countries of Western Europe.
Nowadays, airplanes, cars, electrical appliances, computers, machines and tools are manufactured.
