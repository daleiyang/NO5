Page 63 exercise. C

1
00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:04.690
listening activity.

2
00:00:05.179 --> 00:00:07.030
What a disaster.

3
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.279
Mary is on the phone to her friend, Miriam.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.159
They are talking about last night's bonfire celebration.

5
00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.009
So,

6
00:00:17.218 --> 00:00:19.179
did you have a good time last night?

7
00:00:19.778 --> 00:00:22.849
Well, it was ok, I suppose

8
00:00:23.188 --> 00:00:25.128
first I made a guy

9
00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.409
but I can't sew very well. So I stuck the head on

10
00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:30.929
with glue.

11
00:00:31.188 --> 00:00:32.448
Did it stay on?

12
00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:34.150
Yes. At

13
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.659
first.

14
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.700
Actually, the guy looked pretty good.

15
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.090
So my brother and I decided to go out and ask for a penny for the guy.

16
00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:46.549
We only got a bit of money

17
00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:50.470
and then the head fell off. Oh, dear. Exactly.

18
00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:52.810
And that horrible new boy.

19
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.759
You mean Lee something or other? Yeah,

20
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.869
he walked past and started laughing.

21
00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:01.619
Anyway, after that

22
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.839
I had to change clothes and catch the bus to Lewis.

23
00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.459
Oh, yes, I remember

24
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.769
you wanted to meet up with Adina and the gang at the bonfire celebrations, right?

25
00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:13.019
Cool.

26
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.879
So, were the fireworks? Fantastic.

27
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.339
Uh, well,

28
00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:18.919
I don't really know.

29
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.760
You see,

30
00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:22.269
I missed the bus and,

31
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.059
um, had to go to the bonfire party my parents had at home

32
00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.980
and when I tried to put my potato in the bonfire. I burnt my hair.

33
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.569
Oh, poor you.

34
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.470
But at least you got to see some fireworks, didn't you? Yes.

35
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.349
And they were pretty good.

36
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:41.680
Anyway,

37
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.550
do you still want to go to the movies this evening?

38
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.419
You know what, Mary? I

39
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.800
think it would be safer if you came over to my house and we watched a video instead.
