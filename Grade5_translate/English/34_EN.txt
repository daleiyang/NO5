Toffee apples or Bombs on sticks.
A holiday isn't a holiday without sweets! 
But be careful that these ones don't break your teeth.
This is what you do:
Dissolve the sugar in the water over a medium heat.
When it has dissolve, stir in the vinegar, syrup and butter. 
Bring to a boil and cook without stirring until it reaches 138 celsius.
You can test this by dropping some of the toffee mixture into a glass of cold water.
If it becomes a hard ball, then it is ready. 
This should take about 10 minutes (boiling time).
While the toffee is cooking, make a hole in each apple with a wooden stick.
For the toffee coating.
225 g Demerara or brown sugar.
110 ml water.
0.5 tsp vinegar (that's half a teaspoon).
2 tbsp golden syrup (2 tablespoons).
25g butter.
For the apples.
6 dessert apples.
6 wooden sticks for holding the apples - you can use ice lolly sticks.
When the toffee is ready, dip each apple into the hot toffee and cover it with the sticky toffee mixture.
Leave the apples to harden on a lightly oiled tray before serving. 
If you're planning to keep them for a day or two, wrap the apples in cellophane. Enjoy!
