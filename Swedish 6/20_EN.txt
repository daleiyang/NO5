Planning your writing - the threat/what scares

In most stories there is a problem or obstacle.
In a horror story, the problem is something or someone that threatens or scares the main character.

What is it that scares and is scary in your story?

Describe what scares you. Fill in the mind map with supporting words.

What scares you:

What does it look like?
How is it scared?
Why is it scary?

Stringy long hair, black cleaning coat, bloody indoor shoes, red eyes, icy roar.

Is it the ghost in the toilet in the school basement?
The one who appears in the mirror if you call her name?
