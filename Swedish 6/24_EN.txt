Planning your writing - events, turning points and endings

Events

In a horror story, the tension builds before the turning point and ending.
At first it's a bit exciting, then it gets even more exciting and finally it's super exciting.

Think of three events that should be included in your story.
Write briefly about what will happen in each part.

Event 1 (exciting)

Event 2 (a bit more exciting)

Event 3 (super exciting)

The first time the ghost appears in the mirror in the basement toilet, then she appears in other toilets in the school. 
Finally, she appears in the toilet mirror at the twins' house.
