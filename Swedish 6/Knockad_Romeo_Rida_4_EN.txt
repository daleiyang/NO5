The other actors stood there, staring at each other. No one knew what to do.



Is this part of the show? I heard someone in the audience whisper.



“RIDÅ!” Moa shouted in despair and started pulling at the fabric.



Then a familiar voice was heard above everyone else:



Hey, Romeo!



I spun around and saw a short figure in a puffy costume rushing across the stage like a cannonball. 



It was Ruben. In the next second he had thrown me to the floor. 



I fell handless and hit my head on the wooden planks. 



Someone shouted and there was a commotion on stage. 



Ruben tore at my tattered shirt and all I could see was a flurry of feet and legs rushing back and forth. 



Chair squeaks and baby cries mingled with outraged voices from the audience,



but through all the chaos, I could still make out Hugo Stenborg's mocking laughter.



One last thought ran through my head:



What am I doing here?



Then everything went black.
