Plan your writing

Suggestion:
Get a reading dog for school
Untidy classrooms are a bad working environment
Homework makes students stressed
Introduce relaxation at the end of each school day
Buy good books for the school library
Offer free extracurricular activities during the holidays

Soon you will be writing your own opinion piece.
But first you need to decide what to write about.

Think of a topic that you want to debate.
It should be something that you are really passionate about.
It could be about school, or about something related to your leisure time or society in general. 
Use the suggestions in the box if you like.

Write your opinion. Think of three arguments that you think might work to support it.

My opinion:
Argument 1:
Argument 2:
Argument 3:

I want the basement at school to become a cozy room.
Now there is just a lot of old leftover furniture there.

Argument 1: We pupils have nowhere to go during breaks when the weather is bad.
This means that we are wet and cold when it's time for class.
