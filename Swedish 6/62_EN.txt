Respond to the arguments of others

While you are gathering facts and information, you will probably notice that not everyone thinks the same way you do.
It is then up to you to prepare good counter-arguments.

What opinions do you encounter that do not agree with yours?

Choose one of the opinions and answer it with a counterargument.
Use reference markers.

The headmaster claims that the cellar must be used as a furniture store. 
I can understand this to some extent, but I would argue that a lot of the furniture can be used in the mezzanine.
The rest we can sell at the flea market.
