Introduction and conclusion

Your debate article needs to have an introduction where you give a background to your topic and what your thesis is. 
In the conclusion, your best argument should be restated together with a call to action. 

Why have you chosen this topic for your debate article? 

What argument do you want to include in your conclusion?

What do you want to call for?

In our school, students must always be outside during the breaks.
I think it is unfair that we have to be outside and freeze while the teachers can sit and cozy up in the teachers' room.

Finally, I want to emphasize again that we students should have the same rights as the teachers.
We don't want to be cold during breaks, we want our own room to hang out in.
Support us in our fight.
Bring on the indoor coziness during breaks!
