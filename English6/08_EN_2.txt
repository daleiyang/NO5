Well, as you know both my parents are ecologists so there was no time for a typical holiday. This year we went to Svalbard.



Where's Svalbard?



It’s a Norwegian archipelago midway between Norway and the North Pole.



Wow! What were you doing there?



Well, the first week we all went on a hike to Trollsteinen - the Troll Rock. It’s not really safe because there are polar bears.



They sometimes kill people and eat them. Ugh! Gross!



My mum writes articles for a magazine about the situation of the polar bears.



What do you mean?



Well, global temperatures are rising so the ice is melting and the polar bears have to swim great distances to find food.



I feel sorry for them.



Yes, and sometimes they come to the villages.



Looking for a good meal - you! Anyway, what were you doing all day, then?



I was with my parents a lot but there was also time for me to make cool playlists with my favourite music.



Heavy metal?



Of course! The polar bears sometimes came to our camp looking for food, but I felt safe. I could always scare them off with the music if they attacked us.



I know how they feel! Well, there’s the bell. In we go!
