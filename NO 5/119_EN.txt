Capra ibex. Skilled rock climbers.
Most of the mammals of the Alps are small rodents or ungulates.
Capra ibex is an ungulate that is a good climber.
Both the goat (male) and the goat (female) have long, heavy horns.
Nevertheless, they balance easily on the smallest rock ledge.
The fact that it is so secure on the foot is due to the fact that it can extend and contract its hooves.
In the past, it was believed that the capra ibex's meat was healing against diseases, and therefore it was hunted so fiercely that it was almost extinct.
Another goat-like animal in the Alps is the chamois or mountain goat, as it is also called.
It is smaller than the capra ibex and actually more closely related to antelopes than to goats.
Like the capra ibex, the chamois is a skilled climber.
The chamois is very alert and has an incredibly good sense of smell and hearing.
That makes it difficult to chase it.
Who am I?
Whistles to warn the flock of danger.
Drops bones from dead animals onto rocks to access bone marrow.
Can contract and spread the hooves to get a good grip.
