Edelweiss grows up to 2,500 meters above sea level.
Human impact.
The Alps are the most exploited mountain range in Europe.
This means that many people live there,
that many tourists come there and that there are many buildings in the mountains.
This affects nature a lot.
There are not as large areas of untouched wilderness as in the Swedish mountains.
In several places in the Alps, large parts of the old forests have been cut down.
More and more hotels, slalom runs, ski lifts and roads are being built.
The soil is fertile and potatoes, grain, grapes and fruit are grown.
Cows and sheep graze far up on the alpine slopes.
The larch tree is a hardy tree, which can grow at an altitude of almost 2,500 meters.
It is sensitive to heat, but can handle really cold winters.
A larch tree can be several hundred years old.
Unlike our conifers, spruce and pine, the larch tree sheds its needles in winter.
The bars are not sticky, but soft.
Larch forests are felled for the useful wood, which is tough and durable.
In the past, boats and cabins were built from the wood, and it is still used to build with.
Small but tough.
High up on the alpine slopes grows, just like in the mountains,
only those flowers that are particularly good at surviving in the cold and cold wind.
Edelweiss is a small but tough plant.
It looks like a fuzzy star and is low with hairy leaves, protecting it from the cold.
Many of the flowers that grow in the Alps are found nowhere else in the world.
