The big four's little ones.
The BEAR gives birth to two or three cubs in her den in the middle of winter.
The cubs are naked, blind and weigh only 300-600 grams, about the same as an adult squirrel.
The cubs emerge from the nest in April and follow the female for two to three years.
The female bear usually gives birth to cubs only every two or three years.
The WOLVERINE gives birth to two to three cubs in February-March in a den, often under a snowdrift.
The fawns do not leave the nest until May and follow the female well into winter.
The female wolf gives birth to about six cubs in each litter.
The den can be excavated in a sand dune, under a root ball or between some boulders.
The cubs are born in mid-May.
They weigh like large puppies and are helpless for the first few weeks.
The young are fed by the female for the first few months and then follow both parents for two years or more.
A Lynx gives birth to one to four cubs in a mountain crevasse in May-June.
Like kittens, lynx cubs are born blind.
There is fierce competition for food.
Usually no more than two cubs survive in the same litter.
The cubs and the female stay together for a year, until the next litter is born.
