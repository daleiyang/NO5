Solutions.
If you pour salt into a glass of water, it appears as if the salt disappears.
You can't see the salt, but you can taste it if you drink.
No chemical reaction has taken place, so no new substance has been formed.
The glass still contains both salt and water, 
but the salt is not visible because it has dissolved in the water.
A solution has formed with the water as solvent.
Clean.
When you have to clean and tidy up, sweeping or vacuuming is not always enough.
Dirt that sticks must be washed away.
You can rub with water, but sometimes it is not enough on difficult stains.
With soap, detergent or washing-up liquid, the water becomes a better solvent.
This is because such agents contain substances that can bind grease and dirt so that it can be washed away.
Sometimes you may need an even stronger solvent, for example acetone or white spirit.
Strong solvents often have dangerous fumes that are toxic to inhale.
Therefore, you should always read the packaging before using strong cleaning agents.
Graffiti cleanup.
Glue, adhesive and paint.
There are different adhesives and glues that are used to put things together.
In the tube or bottle are the substances that glue together with solvent,
which evaporates when the glue is exposed to the air. 
When there is no solvent left, the glue dries and hardens.
It becomes firm and hard and holds together what you have glued.
Just like glue, paint contains solvents.
When painting, the solvent evaporates and the paint dries.
Some paints have water as a solvent, 
other paints have stronger solvents that smell when the paint dries.
Such solvents evaporate and the vapors formed are dangerous to inhale.
Therefore, you must air it properly when painting with such paint.
