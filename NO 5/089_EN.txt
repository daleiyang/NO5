concept.
battery: a rechargeable power source.
electrical circuit: when a power source is connected to things like lights and switches.
electrical conductor: Material that conducts electricity well.
electric motor: converts electric current into motion.
the energy principle: energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed between different forms.
fossil fuels: fuels formed in the ground over a very long time, for example oil, coal and natural gas.
renewable energy: energy that is renewed at the same rate as it is used, for example biofuel.
generator: converts motion into electrical current.
non-renewable energy: energy that cannot be regenerated or regenerates very slowly.
insulator: material that does not conduct electricity.
circuit diagram: a drawing that shows an electrical circuit and what components are included.
parallel connection: when, for example, two lamps are connected to a battery, but in separate circuits.
series connection: when, for example, two lights are connected one behind the other in the same circuit, so that neither or both lights up.
static electricity: small electric shocks that cause some clothes or hair to crackle.
power outage: when the power does not arrive, for example because wires have broken during a storm.
circuit: an electrical circuit that can be closed, so that current flows around, or broken, so that current is stopped.
power source: something that provides power, such as a road outlet or a battery.
greenhouse effect: when the atmosphere acts as a greenhouse and prevents heat from escaping into space.
can you now.
What form of energy does all energy end up being?
give examples of what we use energy for.
Name three things you use electricity for.

What is the difference between renewable and non-renewable energy sources?
explain how we humans can affect the greenhouse effect.
