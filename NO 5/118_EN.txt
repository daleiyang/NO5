Animals in the Alps. Lamb vulture. Marmot.
Among the high mountains there are places that are difficult for humans to reach.
This means that animals and birds can move more freely there than down in the valleys.
Up among the forest and rocks, you can find the big predators bear, wolf and lynx.
There are many different bird species in the mountains, including birds of prey such as eagles, falcons and vultures.
The largest bird of prey up in the mountains is the great "bearded vulture".
It is a mighty bird with a wingspan of more than 3 meters.
It has been extinct, but has been reintroduced to once again sail between the rocks in the mountains.
The "bearded vulture" eats mostly dead animals.
Sometimes it flies up high and drops a carcass against the rocks to crush the bones.
Then it can access the juicy marrow inside the bones.
Animals that dig tunnels.
The Alps' counterpart to our mountain lemmings are the marmots.
They are about the size of rabbits and live in burrows on the mountain slopes.
They dig large tunnel systems below ground with passages that can be between 10 and 70 meters long.
Several animals live together in small colonies and whistle loudly to warn each other of dangers.
They often sit upright like squirrels, and scout around.
The marmots eat insects, grass, herbs, rice and roots and hibernate during the winter.
