The mountain range.
In the mountains, the soil layer is thick and can retain water longer.
Tall grasses and flowers thrive here, such as the yellow "trollius europaeus"(globeflower),
the blue aconitum, the blue-purple midsummer flower and the stately "Angelica Archangelica".
Gnats and mosquitoes thrive here, which we humans often find a nuisance, but for many animals these insects are vital.
For the birds, the swarms of mosquitoes are the very best thing about the mountains.
Migratory birds come here every year to raise their young.
They have to catch lots of mosquitoes to feed the young.
Along a mountain stream.
mountain stream's water bounces and splashes between the stones.
In the moist stream ravine, there are full of ferns and a dense screen of willow bushes.
Many different flowers also thrive here.
The roots of the plants are usually strong so as not to be washed away by the water.
Some of the ferns have small brown dots on the underside of the leaves.
They are small clusters of spores.
Ferns belong to the plants that are called spore plants.
This also includes Equisetaceae (horsetail family), lycophytes and mosses.
Spore plants have neither flowers nor seeds, but reproduce by spores.
It is leeward of the stream, because the wind does not reach down to the stream ravine.
The only sounds you hear are the lapping of the water, the buzzing of mosquitoes and the whirring of some dragonflies.
The sun warms nicely.
It is not only mountain plants that thrive here, you can also find common meadow flowers, such as the “ranunculus acris” (buttercup).
Drops of water glisten in the leaves of the “Alchemilla vulgaris” (Lady's mantle).
Then and now.
not in hell itself can it be more vile and ugly than on a bog!
This is roughly what Carl von Linne wrote in 1732 when he came to the mountains during his trip to Sweden.
Maybe Linne would have liked the bog better if he had rubber boots.
In addition, he came to Lapland during the worst mosquito season.
