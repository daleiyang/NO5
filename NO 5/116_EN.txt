Alps.
Mountains are not only found in the Nordic countries, but also elsewhere in Europe.
They are large mountain ranges that stretch through several countries.
The Alps are one of these mountain ranges in central Europe.
The mountain peaks of the Alps are significantly higher than Sweden's highest mountain peaks.
The highest peaks we have in our country reach just over 2000 meters above sea level,
while the alpine peaks reach just over 4,000 meters above sea level.
This is because our mountains are much older than the Alps.
When our mountains were young, they were probably as high and pointed as the peaks of the Alps are today.
But they have been worn down by being covered by heavy ice sheets.
The mountains in the Alps have not had time to wear down as much as the Swedish mountains.

Another difference between the Alps and our Nordic mountains is the tree line.
In the Alps, the trees can grow up to 2000 meters above sea level.
In Sweden, the treeline is around 900 meters above sea level.
Since our mountains are further north, it is colder and harder for the trees to survive at higher altitudes.
Mountain birch forest is not found in the Alps, where coniferous trees, often larch, grow instead.
