at the foot of the mountain.
coniferous forest near the mountains.
at the bottom of the mountain side begins the coniferous forest close to the mountains.
Here you can find really old fir trees.
In a few places, the firs have been allowed to stand in peace for a long time without being felled.
They can be several hundred years old.
Such old forests are important for many species.
On older fir trees, beard lichen can be found hanging from the branches.
Other species of lichen grow on the ground and on tree trunks.
In the forests there are also dead trees, which are important for many birds.
Some birds build their nests in hollow trees, others feed on insects that thrive in dead trees.
On moist bogs.
The bog on the mountain is a wetland with tall tufts of grass and occasional crooked pines.
The polar roller glows white, like the gooseberry flowers.
In late summer, the marsh is golden yellow from cloudberries and red from cranberries.
On a small tuft you can find a blue-purple flower that has a wreath of light green leaves at the ground.
There are some dead flies on the leaves.
The flower is called tätört and is one of the few Swedish carnivorous plants.
The leaves of the sedge are sticky, so that flies and ants get stuck there.
When an insect is stuck, the leaves curl up.
Inside the leaf roll, the insect dissolves and the plant absorbs the nutrients.
In this way, the sedge gets the important nutrients that are found in insects, but which are in short supply in the bogs.

If you are lucky, you may see the moose trampling across the marsh.
Maybe it should stop to eat aquatic plants or take a bath to escape the mosquitoes.
