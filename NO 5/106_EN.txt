Chapter Six.
Europe's last wilderness?
Why does the reindeer have a hairy muzzle?
Are there flowers with fur?
Can fir trees have beards?
Whose ghostly laughter is heard in the forest?
Have you been. in the mountains sometime?
Hiked on flowering moors one summer or skied down a hill at full speed one winter?
When you get up to the mountains far away from traffic and houses, it's like coming to the wilderness.
There are not many places where you can experience it, which is why the mountains are called "Europe's last wilderness".
To call it wilderness is not quite right.
Man has lived and used nature in the mountains for a long time.
But because of the harsh climate, there have never been that many people who lived there.
Now you will find out more about how animals and plants cope with the tough life in the mountains.
