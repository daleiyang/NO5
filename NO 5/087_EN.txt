the energy of the future.
if we think back in time, it is not so long ago that there was neither electric light nor heat in the houses.
A lot has happened in just over a hundred years.
We use more and more energy and all the time new ideas and new technology come up for how to get more energy.
If we are to get enough energy without harming health and the environment, we need to use other energy sources than we do today.
it is important to find solutions that can be good for a long time.
different choices and different possibilities.
all energy sources have both advantages and disadvantages.
You think about the environment and the climate, but also how much it costs.
nuclear power provides a lot of energy, but at the same time it produces hazardous waste that is difficult and risky to store.
wind and hydropower produce no emissions, but they affect nature in other ways.
In addition, not all countries on earth have the same opportunity to acquire energy.
The richer industrialized countries can afford to consume much more energy than the poorer countries.
What can you do?
We need to learn more about what is happening to the climate.
We must understand that what we do in one place can affect what happens in other places.
What affects the climate and nature when we use energy and emit exhaust gases?
Even if we find new solutions, we have to get better at saving energy.
Everyone can do a little, but together it becomes a lot.
What can you do at home?
What can you do at school?
How can you influence the adults around you so that there is a change?

Many people in the world live without access to electricity, like here in the West Bank in Palestine.
With the help of small wind turbines or solar cells, they can make their own electricity.
