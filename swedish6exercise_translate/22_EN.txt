One or than? 



Read the poem. Underline all the ones and only ones.



Circle all thans and ends.



I had a friend



I still remember him.



He was more kind than naughty.



I was more ugly than handsome.



We traveled around every country



And saw oceans and desert sands



All the way to the North Pole we steered our course



Our friendship was like a beautiful rose



The only thing that could break up our team



Was that he fell in love with the same girl as me.



Ever since then we've been enemies



My only friend How did it come to this?



Homophones are words that are pronounced the same but spelled differently.



One and than are two homophones that can sometimes cause problems in writing.



One is a word that is about numbers.



I have a friend, Once I got ...



Than is a word used when comparing: I am bigger than you.



Yet can also explain a passage of time that is still ongoing or has not ended.



The cycle is broken yet.



The words enda and Ã¤nda are also homophones.



Only is a word that also has to do with number:



You are the only one for me.



End is a noun that is synonymous with a rear end:



I hit my butt when I fell.



Finally can also be the end of a period of time:



Winter has finally come to an end.



Finish the a and than poem by completing the lines you have started.



You are still



I am still



We two are one



Our friendship will last until the end



One day we will



You and me.



Me and you.
