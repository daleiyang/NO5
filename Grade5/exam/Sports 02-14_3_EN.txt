Diet. The body needs regular food to feel good. 
If you eat three main meals a day and two snacks, your body feels good. 
The three main meals are breakfast, lunch and dinner.
If you exercise in the evening, you also need an evening meal. 
The body needs to get the right energy in small amounts but often to feel good. 
Eating little but often keeps your blood sugar levels steady and reduces the fatigue that can occur if you haven't eaten for too long. 
Having a snack will boost your mood and concentration. 
A snack can consist of fruit, sandwiches, pasta salad, vegetables, muesli etc.
Many people enjoy eating sugar, drinking juice and soft drinks, popping popcorn and watching a good movie. 
These things are not something the body needs to feel good, rather the opposite.
Unhealthy foods too much and too often can be downright harmful to your body and your health.
