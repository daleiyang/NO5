Durable shapes



When you want to build stably, it is important to build structures with durable shapes. 



The most common shapes are the arch, triangle and tube.



The arch is particularly good if it is a heavy structure. 



The arch was used early on in old church buildings.



The triangle is a very stable shape.



The triangle is especially common in trusses.



The tube has a round shape and is equally strong in all directions. 



The tube is used when building wind turbines and various towers.



Bridges



The very first bridges were probably built to allow people to cross a river or perhaps a cliff. 



Such bridges were simple and consisted of tree branches, planks and stones.



Early Romans built sturdy bridges and stone aqueducts, using arched structures.



An aqueduct was used as a water conduit. 



In other words, a kind of bridge to transport water.
