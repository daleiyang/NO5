Durable and stable structures



When building houses, bridges, railways, power plant dams and even furniture,



they must be stable structures and at the same time have good strength.



Strength means that the material can withstand pressure or being pulled by the material.



It must therefore be durable.



Durable materials



Different materials are used, depending on what you are building. 



Materials are often chosen according to the cost of the structure.



Common materials used in construction are wood and metals, 



but also natural materials such as concrete, brick, porcelain, plaster and glass. 



These materials are made of stone and clay and have high strength and heat resistance.



Some synthetic materials, which are man-made, are also useful. 



Mainly rubber and various plastics. 



These materials are cheap to produce. 



They can also have the property of being elastic, i.e. stretchable.

Trusses



When building bridges, for example, you want to build sturdily, but still save on materials, because a bridge is a very expensive structure.



By building with metal beams, you get a stable structure, which also lets the wind through.



This construction technique is called trussing. 



The Eiffel Tower in Paris is built using truss technology.
