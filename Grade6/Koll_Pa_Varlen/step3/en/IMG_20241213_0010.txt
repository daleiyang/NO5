The Earth
When you have read this chapter you should know...
...how our solar system is constructed.
...what conditions are necessary for life to arise.
...what different forces affect the appearance of the Earth's surface.
...where the world's major mountain ranges are located and what they are called.
We live in an enormous universe that contains everything we know and much more.
Our universe could very well be infinitely large, without any end, no one knows for sure.
The universe was probably created at the Big Bang (the great explosion).
It occurred about 14 billion years ago.
The Big Bang caused the universe to expand rapidly in less than a second.
Then it took hundreds of millions of years before the first stars formed.
The Milky Way â€“ our galaxy
A galaxy is a large cohesive group of stars.
There are many billions of galaxies in the universe.
The Earth and our solar system are a very small part of the Milky Way galaxy.
No one knows for sure how many stars there are in the Milky Way, but it is probably around 100 billion.
