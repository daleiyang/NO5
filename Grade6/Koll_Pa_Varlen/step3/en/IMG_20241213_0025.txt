Monsoon Winds
Monsoon winds are winds that blow from one direction for half of the year, then in the opposite direction for the remainder of the year.
Monsoon winds arise due to the temperature difference between land and sea.
Because the monsoon winds change direction with the seasons, they are also called seasonal winds.
Where monsoon winds occur, there are only two seasons, winter and summer.
Monsoon winds blow over different parts of the world but are strongest in the southern and southeastern parts of Asia.
Summer Monsoon
During the summer half of the year, Asia's land surface becomes much warmer than the sea.
The warm air rises, and strong winds from the sea replenish it with new air.
The winds bring warm and humid air.
When the air comes over the land, it rises.
Then it cools and it begins to rain.
In India, the summer monsoon comes from the southwest over the Ghats.
The mountain range forces the humid air to rise, it cools, and rain pours down.
Often more than 5,000 mm of rain falls in half a year.
When the monsoon rains pass across India, the fields are drenched in rain, and extensive and devastating floods often occur.
At the foot of the Himalayas, the amounts of rain are record-breaking.
The town of Cherrapunji, in northern India, is one of the places where it rains most in the world.
At most, 26,000 mm of rain has fallen in a year, but the average is about 10,000 mm per year.
This can be compared with Stockholm, which gets a little more than 500 mm of precipitation a year.
Winter Monsoon
In winter, the winds blow from land out towards the sea instead.
This is because Asia's land surface is much colder than the sea surface.
Over the sea, the warm air rises, and new air is supplied.
The wind that supplies comes from inner Asia, where it is winter.
