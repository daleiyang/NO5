The rainforest is teeming with life.
The rainforest is teeming with life.
More than half of the world's plant and animal species live in the rainforest.
Scientists also estimate that there are still many species that have not yet been discovered.
Parrots and toucans are two colorful bird species that thrive in the rainforest.
They live on seeds and fruits.
The toucan is recognized by its large and colorful beak.
Since the beak is filled with air holes, it is not as heavy as it appears to be.
Many monkeys have their homes in the rainforest.
Orangutans live in the rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia.
They use their strong arms to swing around in the treetops in search of fruit.
Chimpanzees and gorillas are found in the African rainforests.
Gorillas live most of their lives on the ground.
Males get really big and can weigh close to 200 kilograms.
Monkeys are now endangered species.
This is partly because their habitats disappear when the rainforests are cut down.
Another reason is that they are hunted for their meat.
There are quite a few animals in the rainforest that can be dangerous to humans.
Poisonous frogs, alligators, and snakes thrive here.
The world's largest snake, the anaconda, lives in the rainforests of South America.
It thrives in water and is an excellent swimmer.
The anaconda can grow up to 10 meters long.
It is very strong and kills its prey by coiling around it and then drowning or suffocating it.
With its size and strength, the anaconda is even capable of killing crocodiles.
The blue poison dart frog lives only in southern Suriname.
The poison dart frogs are named because the indigenous people of the Amazon dip their arrows in the frogs' toxic skin secretions.
The frogs have bright, vivid colors to warn other animals that might want to eat them.
