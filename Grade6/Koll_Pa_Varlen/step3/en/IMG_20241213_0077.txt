The world's oceans cover more than 70 percent of the earth's surface and are divided into five oceans.
The oceans are further divided into several smaller seas.
Some of the seas are called inland seas, for example, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean, and the Persian Gulf.
Inland seas have the same inlets as outlets.
Therefore, the turnover of water is small.
Salt content in various seas
Red Sea 4.1%
Mediterranean Sea 3.8%
Oceans on average 3.5%
Baltic Sea 1%
Saltwater
Most of the water on earth is saltwater that is found in the sea.
It is the rain falling over land that replenishes the seas with saltwater.
On its way down to the sea, the rainwater takes salt from the bedrock that makes the sea salty.
The salinity of the sea can be measured in percent.
The average salinity of the world's oceans is 3.5 percent.
The highest salinity is found in the Red Sea.
It rarely rains here and it is very warm all year round.
Therefore, evaporation is high.
Some seas have neither freshwater nor saltwater, they have brackish water.
Their salinity is between that of the oceans and freshwater.
Seas with brackish water have little contact with the oceans' salty water but are continuously replenished with freshwater.
This is the case with the Baltic Sea, the world's largest sea with brackish water.
Rivers and streams add freshwater, but saltwater from the Atlantic finds it harder to enter.
The Black Sea is another sea with brackish water.
