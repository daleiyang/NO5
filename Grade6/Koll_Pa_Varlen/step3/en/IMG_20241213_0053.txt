How do we use the resources in a sustainable way?
It was previously believed that the earth's resources were infinite and that emissions from industries and cars just disappeared without causing any problems.
Today we know that oil, gasoline, and coal will not last forever.
Moreover, they pollute the environment.
It is not enough that we try to use less of the energy sources that are not renewable.
We also need to get better at finding alternatives to them.
This means, among other things, that we must find even better ways to use energy from the sun, wind, and water.
Another way to contribute to a sustainable use of the earth's resources is to reuse the resources we have already used.
This can, for example, involve recycling paper, metals, and glass.
We must also consider what we buy and how far different goods need to be transported.
Perhaps it is wiser to buy apples from Sweden than from countries on the other side of the globe.
Instead of refueling with gasoline, more car owners in the future will be able to charge car batteries with electricity.
It can be as simple as taking the bike instead of the car.
Are you aware that...
...if the sun shines for an hour over Sweden in May, it provides as much energy as we consume in a whole year.
...it is possible to build houses that are only heated by the body heat from those who live there and by the electrical appliances in the house.
...that the world's oil reserves will probably last for 40 to 60 years at today's consumption rates.
