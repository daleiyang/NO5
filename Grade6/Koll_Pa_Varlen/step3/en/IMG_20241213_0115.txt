Australia's Wildlife
The wildlife in Australia is very special.
Here there are many species that only live in Australia and nearby islands.
This is because the continent has been separated from other landmasses for a very long time.
Species that have long been extinct in other parts of the world have survived here.
At the same time, land animals that evolved on other continents have not reached Australia.
Marsupials, like kangaroos, koalas, and sugar gliders, are only found in Australia.
Another strange animal is the platypus, which has a bill and lays eggs but is a mammal.
Australia has 130 species of land-dwelling snakes, and many of them are very venomous, such as the taipan and death adder.
These two species are considered some of the most dangerous snakes in the world.
The Great Barrier Reef
The Great Barrier Reef stretches along Australia's northeastern coast and is the world's longest coral reef, 1,900 kilometers long.
In the Great Barrier Reef, there are many different species of plants and animals, such as whales, dolphins, turtles, and numerous birds, fish, and mussels.
The area is therefore visited by many tourists who dive and snorkel in the clear blue water.
Corals are animals that live on coral reefs, such as sea anemones and stony corals.
As the corals die, the reef is built up by the animals' skeletons.
Some coral reefs can become so large that they reach the sea surface.
Many coral reefs are exposed to various environmental threats.
Many fish species thrive here, and therefore harsh fishing is conducted, including with dynamite.
Beautiful corals are broken off the reefs to be sold as ornaments, and corals are also extracted to make lime.
To protect the Great Barrier Reef, it was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981.
