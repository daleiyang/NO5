Lake Chad
Lake Chad in Africa was once the world's fourth largest lake, but now it is disappearing.
It has shrunk by more than 90 percent since the mid-1960s.
When the lake was larger, it bordered four countries: Chad, Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria.
Today it only borders two, Chad and Cameroon.
There are several reasons why the once large lake has shrunk.
The main reason is that more and more people are using the lake's water.
Today, almost 40 million people depend on the water from Lake Chad and the number is likely to increase to 55 million by 2020.
Additionally, a drier climate and increased artificial irrigation have contributed to drying up the lake.
As precipitation has decreased, the need for irrigation has increased.
Several of Chad's largest rivers are almost emptied of their water before they even reach the lake.
The annual monsoon rain has become the most important water source, but the amount of rainwater is not enough to fill Lake Chad.
More and more fishermen are turning to cultivating the land that was once the lakebed.
Corn, potatoes, and sugar are crops grown in the area.
Everything indicates that Lake Chad will continue to shrink and may even completely disappear during the 21st century.
