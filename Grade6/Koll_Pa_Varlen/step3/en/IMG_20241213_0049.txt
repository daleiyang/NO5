The forest and the land
People have always benefited from the forest because it provides us with fuel.
Most of the world's poor people still use wood as their only source of energy.
From the forest, we also get various wood products such as building materials, furniture, and pulp.
The cultivated land gives us food and on the grasslands, livestock can graze.
Bedrock
From various minerals in the bedrock, we get iron, copper, gold, and diamonds, for example.
Iron is used to make steel that can be used to build skyscrapers, manufacture cars and much more.
In the bedrock, there is also oil, natural gas, and coal from which we get energy.
Population
Humans have learned to utilize the Earth's resources in different ways.
We can cultivate the land, mine ore in the mines, and construct wind turbines.
Therefore, humans are also considered an important resource.
Our resources can be divided into renewable and non-renewable.
The renewable resources do not run out no matter how much we use them.
Non-renewable resources exist in limited amounts and can therefore run out.
