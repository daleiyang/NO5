Building forces
The earth has not always looked the same, it is constantly changing.
Different forces affect the appearance of the earth's surface.
Some forces build up the surface of the earth and others break it down.
The earth's crust is divided into a number of plates that move in different directions by a few centimeters per year.
The movement of the plates affects the surface of the earth in several different ways.
Mountain range folding
Where the plates collide with each other, high mountains can form.
The collision causes the earth's crust to be compressed.
This causes the rock to fold and slowly rise upwards.
This is called mountain range folding.
The worldâ€™s highest mountain range, the Himalayas, was formed in this way.
As the plates continue to move towards each other, the Himalayas rise by a few centimeters a year.
Other major mountain ranges where plates collide are the Alps and the Andes.
Did you know...
... that most volcanoes are located at the bottom of the ocean.
... that 150 million years ago Sweden was approximately where the Canary Islands are now.
Since then, the plate on which Sweden rests has moved.
