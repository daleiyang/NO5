The wind affects the climate
Wind is air that moves.
The sun is the engine of the wind.
When the sun warms the air, it starts to move.
The warm air is light and therefore rises, cold air is heavier and sinks down.
It is this exchange between warm and cold air that gives rise to winds.
The exchange between warm and cold air follows certain patterns that create large wind systems across the entire globe.
These wind systems affect the climate.
Trade Winds
The sun heats the air around the equator so much that it evaporates large amounts of water from the plants in the rainforest and from the ocean.
The warm moist air rises, but when it reaches higher altitudes, it cools down.
Then large clouds form that provide heavy rainfall.
That is why it rains almost every day in areas around the equator.
When the air moves farther from the equator, it becomes cooler and starts to sink.
Since the air has lost all moisture, it is now very dry.
This is the explanation for why there are large deserts in these areas.
At the same time as the warm air rises at the equator, it is replaced by dry air coming from the dry areas north and south of the equator.
The air goes in a constant cycle between the equator and desert areas.
The winds that constantly blow towards the equator are called trade winds.
