What is geography?
Geography is about our earth and about us humans who live here.
When you study geography, you learn what the earth looks like and why it appears as it does.
You also learn how we humans use and affect the earth in different ways.
A good way to learn geography is to ask questions about a place or an area.
An important question is "Why is it like this here?"
It's possible to ask many questions about one single place.
Where in the world could the picture be taken?
Why has a large dam been built here?
Why is there no settlement around the dam?
What did it look like here before the power station was built?
How could the landscape in the picture have been formed like this?
Why do the mountains have different colors?
Why could this type of nature interest people?
