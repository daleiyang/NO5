In large parts of southern Asia, the water buffalo is the most important domestic animal.
It is easy to tame and can live over 30 years.
The water buffalo is used as a draft animal in rice cultivation and to drive pumps and mills.
In fields under water, the water buffalo is more suitable than motor-driven agricultural machinery.
From the water buffalo, one also gets meat and milk.
The camel is an important domestic animal in arid areas of Africa and western Asia.
It is used as a pack animal, but meat and milk are also obtained from it.
Some nomadic groups raise camels for export to nearby countries.
Nomads
In areas with very dry climates, for example in Africa's steppes and savannas, livestock is particularly important for people.
Here, the soil and climate are not suitable for crop cultivation, making livestock farming more important.
In these areas, several groups of people live by following the animals, particularly cattle, sheep, and goats, between different grazing areas.
These groups of people are called nomads.
The animals are moved between different areas during the year depending on where the best grazing and access to water are available.
For nomads, the animals are the most important and from them, they get most of what they need to survive.
Other agricultural products, such as grain and vegetables, they buy from nearby farmers.
