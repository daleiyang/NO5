When you have read this chapter, you should know ...
... where the world's most important industrial areas are located.
... why industries are located where they are.
... which are the most important industrial countries outside Europe.
... what globalization can mean.
Industries and industrial areas are found all over the earth.
An industrial area can encompass many cities and stretch over hundreds of kilometers.
The largest and most important industrial areas in the world are in the USA, Europe, and East Asia.
The first factories were started in Europe in the mid-1700s.
Several European countries still belong to the world's most important industrial countries.
Why is the industry located right here?
It is rarely by chance that an industry starts.
Often there are several factors that determine the location.
For example, oil refineries are always located by the coast.
This is because oil is transported there by large oil tankers.
Tech companies are often located where there are plenty of young people with higher education.
Energy
Many industries require enormous amounts of energy.
Manufacturing, for example, paper and aluminum, consumes vast amounts of energy.
In the wealthy countries, there is access to the energy that industries need.
