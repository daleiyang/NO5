Protective atmosphere.
The Earth's atmosphere is also very important for life on Earth.
The atmosphere consists of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), and other gases (1%).
It acts as a filter that protects the Earth from harmful radiation and meteorite impacts.
Sometimes shooting stars are visible in the sky.
These are meteors (stones) from space that burn up in the atmosphere.
Only if the meteors are large do they fall to the Earth.
Are we alone in the universe?
So far, no evidence has been found that life exists anywhere other than on Earth.
Nowadays, astronomers have begun searching for life on planets in other solar systems.
If they can find a planet similar to Earth, there might be life there.
But planets around other stars are far too distant for us to visit them.
The atmosphere is usually divided into three different layers.
The lowest layer is called the troposphere.
It contains almost all the water vapor in the atmosphere.
Above the troposphere is the stratosphere.
Here is the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful solar radiation.
Then comes the ionosphere, which transitions into outer space.
