staple food
Food that we eat often and in large quantities is called staple food.
Examples of staple foods are rice, potatoes, corn, and wheat.
Wheat
Wheat and rice are the most common crops on earth.
Wheat thrives well in humid areas with a temperate climate.
It is mainly grown in North America, Europe, and Asia.
From wheat we get flour for bread, cakes, and pasta.
Wheat is also used in glue and paint.
Some of the largest producers of wheat are the USA, Russia, and China.
A large part of the wheat produced is exported.
Since wheat is easy to store, it can be transported over long distances.
corn
We often eat corn kernels in salads, but corn is also used to make cornmeal, corn oil, and flakes (corn flakes).
But the largest part of all corn grown is used for animal feed.
The USA and China are the countries that grow the most corn in the world.
Cassava
Cassava is a shrub that can grow several meters high.
Cassava is a staple food in several countries in Asia, Africa, and South America.
The shrub is most common in areas with a tropical climate.
Both the root and the leaves can be used in cooking.
Since the roots contain a toxic substance (cyanide), they must be peeled, ground, and boiled before they can be eaten.
The leaves are also toxic before cooking, but if prepared correctly, they are filling and nutritious.
The leaves taste somewhat like spinach and contain many vitamins.
The root can otherwise be used for mash and pancakes.
Cassava can also be used to make chips, juice, glue, and flour.
