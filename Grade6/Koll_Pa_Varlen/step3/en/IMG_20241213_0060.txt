Useful plants
Cotton
Very many clothes contain cotton.
Cotton is mainly grown in the tropical and subtropical climate zones.
In China, USA, India, and Pakistan, cotton cultivation is very important.
Cotton farming requires large amounts of water.
Since the cultivation takes place in dry areas, artificial irrigation is used.
The water is taken from rivers and dams and led out to the cotton fields.
The cotton bush is sensitive to attacks from pests.
Therefore, large amounts of chemical pesticides are used in the plantations.
They are not only harmful to nature but also toxic to the people working in the fields.
Sugarcane
More than half of all sugar in the world is produced from sugarcane, the rest comes from sugar beets.
Sugarcane is a plant that resembles reeds and can grow up to 4 meters tall.
In the stalk there is juice rich in sugar, and it is from this juice that sugar is made.
Large sugarcane plantations exist in India and Brazil.
Ecological clothing
It is possible to buy clothes made of organic cotton that has been grown without pesticides.
Organic farming is much healthier for the people working in the fields and the environment is less damaged.
Another advantage is that the risk of allergies is reduced for those who wear the clothes.
Since the harvest of organic cotton is smaller, organic clothes are often slightly more expensive than regular clothes.
Organic cotton is grown, among other places, in Turkey, the USA, and India.
From sugarcane, it is also possible to produce ethanol that can be used as fuel in ethanol cars.
