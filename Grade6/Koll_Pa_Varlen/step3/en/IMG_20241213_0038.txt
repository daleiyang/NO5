The disaster in New Orleans
On the afternoon of August 29, 2005, the city of New Orleans was struck by one of the worst natural disasters ever in the USA.
Then Hurricane Katrina swept over the city.
Large parts of New Orleans are below sea level.
The land has been drained and large levees have been built against the Gulf of Mexico to hold back the water.
When Hurricane Katrina hit the city, the levees broke and large amounts of water rushed in.
Soon, 80 percent of New Orleans was covered by water.
People had to flee to rooftops and many were stuck there for days.
Hurricane Katrina left more than 100,000 people homeless and about 1,400 people lost their lives.
Tropical cyclones
Tropical cyclones are enormous whirlwinds powered by warm seawater.
They form over tropical seas when the surface water is warmer than 27Â°C.
The winds in tropical cyclones are strong and have a speed of at least 33 meters per second.
When they reach land, the strong winds together with heavy rains can destroy houses and lead to flooding.
Tropical cyclones can also push seawater ahead of them, driving immense water masses over the coasts.
Tropical cyclones are also called hurricanes.
In Asia, they are called typhoons.
