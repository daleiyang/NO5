The resources in the bedrock
Minerals
The bedrock is made up of different rocks.
The rocks consist of one or more different minerals.
There are about 4,000 different minerals that we humans know, such as coal, diamonds, copper, iron, and gold.
Minerals are non-renewable resources.
There is only a certain amount of mineral in the earth's crust.
Some researchers believe that there are large amounts of minerals that have yet to be discovered.
We therefore do not know how long they will last.
Some important metals
When the bedrock contains so much mineral that it is profitable to extract, it is called ores.
Around the world, there are large mines where, among other things, iron ore, copper ore, and zinc ore are extracted.
Different metals are produced from the ores.
Humans have used metals for thousands of years.
Some of the first metals used were iron, copper, and gold.
They were used for tools, weapons, and jewelry.
Even today, iron, copper, and gold are important to us, but we also use many other metals.

Platinum
Platinum is a valuable metal that is more expensive than gold.
South Africa and Russia are the countries that produce the most platinum.
Platinum has high resistance to acids and is also very hard.
The metal is used, among other things, in jet engines and in surgical instruments (used by doctors to operate).
Platinum is also used in the ballpoint of pens, in jewelry, and in watches.
Titanium
Titanium is a metal that does not rust.
It is strong but still weighs little.
Therefore, titanium is suitable for use in airplanes, submarines, and spacecraft.
Since the metal does not cause allergies, it can also be used in the human body.
Bone fractures can be repaired with titanium nails.
