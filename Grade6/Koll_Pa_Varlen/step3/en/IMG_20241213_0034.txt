Living in the desert
The dry climate and lack of water make it difficult for animals, plants, and people to live in the desert.
Despite this, about 600 million people live in desert areas.
Some of them are nomads who live on livestock herding.
They are not settled but move around with their animals to places where there is enough food and water.
Even though the desert landscape appears dead, there are animals and plants that cope with the harsh climate.
They have specialized in different ways to be able to survive.
Some plants have large root systems to be able to gather water from as large areas as possible.
There are also plants whose seeds survive several years of drought.
When the rare rains come, they sprout quickly.
Despite the heat in the desert, it is important to wear a lot of clothes.
The clothes protect the skin from the sun's burning rays and keep out the heat.
Often the clothes are white because white color reflects the sun's rays.
Spiders, lizards, scorpions, and snakes are some examples of animals that live in the desert.
During the day, when it's hottest, they are usually beneath the surface.
When dusk falls and it gets cooler, they come out of their burrows.
Resting during the day and being active at night is a way to adapt to the desert climate.
The camel is one of the few larger animals that can survive in the desert.
Its thick fur protects against both the cold at night and the heat during the day.
The camel can drink up to 200 liters of water at one time.
Then it can go without liquid for two weeks.
Many desert animals only need small amounts of water to survive.
The desert jerboa doesn't need to drink water; it survives on the moisture it gets from food.
It eats seeds, insects, and cacti.
