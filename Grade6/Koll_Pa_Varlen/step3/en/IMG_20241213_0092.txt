Lakes change and disappear
Lakes constantly change and a lake can even disappear completely.
There can be several reasons.
One reason is that the watercourse flowing from the lake digs deeper into the ground and takes more and more water with it.
Another reason is that evaporation in dry areas becomes so great that it exceeds the amount of rainfall.
A lake can also disappear because it overgrows.
It is a natural process that today is accelerated due to eutrophication, that is, too much nitrogen is released into the watercourses.
The Aral Sea
An increasingly common reason is that lakes slowly disappear because humans divert too much water used for irrigation in fields or industries.
An example of such a lake is the Aral Sea, which has almost completely disappeared.
This is because the lake has been drained of water used to irrigate large agricultural areas, especially cotton fields in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.
The surface water level of the Aral Sea has dropped by almost 20 meters since the 1960s.
The salinity of the lake has increased significantly.
Previously it was about 1 percent, but now it is almost as high as in the Dead Sea.
Now the previous lake bed is a salt desert instead.
