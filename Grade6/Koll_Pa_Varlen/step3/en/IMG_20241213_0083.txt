Mangrove forest
A mangrove forest consists of different trees and bushes that can grow in salt water.
Typical for a mangrove forest are the labyrinths of roots.
It is in this tangle of roots, branches, and trunks that various shellfish, fish larvae, and other small animals thrive.
This is also where the giant prawns live.
The sought-after shrimp is sold worldwide today.
Many mangrove forests are now being cut down to make way for large farms of giant prawns that are exported to rich countries.
The prawns are farmed in Asia and Latin America but also in Africa and the Middle East.
The giant prawns we import to Sweden mainly come from Thailand and Indonesia.
Today, more than half of the world's mangrove forests have disappeared.
Millions of people who have sourced food, wood, building materials, and medicine from the forest are forced to relocate.
When the forest is cut down, they lose their livelihood opportunities because the fishing is completely destroyed.
Mangrove forests also have another important role to fulfill.
Besides being home to various marine animals, they protect the coasts and the people living there from erosion, floods, and tsunamis.
This was clearly evident during the tsunami that hit the coasts around the Indian Ocean in 2004.
The areas where mangrove forests remained fared better than other areas.
