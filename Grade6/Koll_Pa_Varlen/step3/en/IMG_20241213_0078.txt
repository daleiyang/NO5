Ocean Currents
The sea is constantly moving.
Huge amounts of water circulate in different currents in the sea.
Ocean currents are affected by water temperature, salinity, wind, and tides.
Warm water flows from the equator towards the poles.
There, the water cools, sinks toward the bottom, and flows back towards the equator.
In this way, there is a heat exchange in the sea between the poles and the equator.
Ocean currents, with their warm or cold water, affect the climate where they pass.
The Gulf Stream is an ocean current with warm water that affects the climate in Western Europe, especially in the North.
It would be significantly cooler here if the Gulf Stream did not exist.

The Seafloor
The seafloor is like a landscape with vast plains, deep valleys, and high mountain ranges.
The oceans are traversed by a huge, continuous mountain range, the Mid-Ocean Ridge.
On both sides of the mountain range, deep-sea plains extend.
The average depth of the world ocean is 3,729 meters.
The greatest depth measured is the Challenger Deep (11,034 m) located in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean.
The deepest parts of the sea are called deep-sea trenches.
