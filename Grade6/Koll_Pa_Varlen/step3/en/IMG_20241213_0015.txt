Volcanoes
Volcanoes are another force that builds up the earth's surface.
Volcanoes are most common along the edges of tectonic plates.
A volcano forms when magma (melted rocks) rises from the Earth's interior.
When the hot magma reaches the Earth's surface, it is called lava.
There it is cooled by water or air and solidifies.
In this way, new rocks are formed.
Volcanoes can look very different.
In some volcanoes, the lava flows out in a rather calm stream for a long time.
Such volcanoes are found among other places in Hawaii.
There, enormous amounts of lava have flowed out over millions of years and built up the islands that make up Hawaii.
When the lava is more viscous, it can get stuck inside the volcano.
More and more lava accumulates and the pressure in the volcano increases.
Finally, the volcano has an explosive eruption where the lava is thrown high into the air.
Then the whole mountain can collapse.
The enormous cloud of smoke formed during powerful eruptions contains ash and gases.
Often it is not the scorching lava, but the gases that kill most people and animals.
That's because they are toxic to breathe in.
Really powerful volcanic eruptions can affect the climate.
In 1815, the volcano Tambora in Indonesia had a powerful eruption.
Gas and dust from Tambora prevented some sunlight from reaching the Earth.
This led to the climate becoming much colder than usual.
The year after the eruption became known as "the year without a summer".
In North America, people froze to death in snowstorms that hit the continent in the summer.
The cold also led to crop failures and famine in Europe.
This is a satellite image of the volcanic island Anak Krakatoa in Indonesia.
The black is solidified lava.
Here you can clearly see how the lava flows constantly make the island grow.
When the lava reaches the earth's surface, it has a temperature of around 1,000Â°C.
The lava can flow several kilometers before it cools and solidifies.
