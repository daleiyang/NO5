A planet full of life
Life on Earth arose about 3.5 billion years ago.
Why is there life here and not on any of the other planets in our solar system?
The answer is not entirely simple.
No one knows exactly what is required for life to exist on a planet, but three things seem to be particularly important: the distance to the sun, the presence of water, and a protective atmosphere.
Distance to the sun
Earth is at just the right distance from the sun for life to exist.
If the Earth were closer, it would be too hot, and if it were farther away, it would be too cold for life to arise.
Water
It was in the ocean that life on Earth began.
Scientists believe that water has a decisive significance for the emergence of life.
So far, water in liquid form has not been found on any other planet in the solar system.
On Mars, water exists as vapor and ice, and on Venus, water exists only as vapor.
