Where do we live?
Some places on earth are very densely populated.
This is because there is fertile soil and the climate is good for cultivation.
Many people also live near the coasts and waterways.
The most densely populated areas are in northeastern North America, Western Europe, and southeastern Asia.
More than half of the world's population lives in Asia, where China and India are the most populous countries.
Other areas on earth are sparsely populated or completely uninhabited.
The cause is often the harsh climate that makes it very difficult or even impossible to survive there.
Desert, mountain, and tundra areas are therefore very sparsely populated.
