Desert Cities
There are several cities located in the middle of the desert.
Some have grown up around oases.
Other cities rely on transporting water from the surroundings.
Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh, has a typical desert climate with very little rainfall.
At the beginning of the 20th century, Riyadh had only 10,000 inhabitants.
Large oil deposits have led to a significant increase in population since then.
People from all over Asia have moved to Riyadh for work.
Today, 4.5 million people live here.
The rapid population growth has led to a constant increase in demand for water.
Some of Riyadh's water comes from desalinated seawater.
The water is desalinated in facilities on the coast and then transported in long pipelines to the city.
It takes a lot of energy to produce fresh water in this way.
Las Vegas is located in the Mojave Desert in the USA.
The little rainfall that occurs is not enough to supply the city with water.
Las Vegas gets its water from a man-made lake on the Colorado River.
But the water level in the lake is falling, and this puts Las Vegas in an acute water shortage.
Special rules have been introduced to prevent people from wasting water.
For example, people can only wash their cars once a week and sprinklers can only be used on certain days.
Those who break the rules may be fined.
The sun shines in the desert from an eternally clear sky.
Therefore, it is excellent to build solar power plants there.
In 2008, construction began on a new solar power plant in the Mojave Desert in California.
When the solar power plant is completed, it will be one of the largest in the world.
It will consist of tens of thousands of large mirrors capturing the sun's rays.
