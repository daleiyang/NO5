Uneven distribution.
Despite there being plenty of water on earth, many people suffer from water scarcity.
The problem is that some countries have plenty of water while others have almost none.
Freshwater in the world is unevenly distributed.
Poor countries with hot and dry climates often have little fresh water.
There are also many people who must share the water.
In Sweden, it is the opposite; it often rains and snows here.
That means we have plenty of water.
We are also few, compared to many other countries, who must share the water.
What affects the availability of water is how much precipitation falls, how large the evaporation is, and what the vegetation in the area looks like.
