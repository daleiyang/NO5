Many lack clean water.
More than 2.6 billion people lack clean drinking water and access to toilets.
In poor countries, almost all wastewater is discharged untreated into watercourses.
The dirty water contributes not only to a poor environment but also to poor health for those forced to use it.
One of the most common causes of diseases in many poor countries is the lack of toilets.
Most people have to resort to ditches and bushes to relieve themselves.
In the feces, there are often worms, parasites, and other bacteria that easily spread.
Many rivers become polluted on their way to the sea.
An example is the Yamuna River, which originates in the Himalayan mountain range.
When the river reaches New Delhi, the capital of India, it is filled with clean water.
But after it passes the city with its 17 million inhabitants, the water is heavily polluted.
This is because the sewage flows directly into the river.
All the millions of people living downstream still have to use the dirty water for both hygiene and cooking.
In countries where many people cannot read, images are used for information.
The sign shows that one should not relieve oneself in nature as it pollutes the water.
Additionally, the risk of snake bites is high.
Ways to Change.
Building toilets is an important path to cleaner water.
But in the long term, education and knowledge are crucial to prevent people from getting sick.
In poor countries, women are responsible for family cooking.
It can take many hours to fetch the water the family needs every day.
Often it is the girls in the family who are responsible for fetching water.
This means that their schooling suffers.
Since it is the women who do the cooking, it is important for the girls to learn the importance of hygiene.
The UN is working to halve the number of people lacking clean drinking water and toilets by 2015.
