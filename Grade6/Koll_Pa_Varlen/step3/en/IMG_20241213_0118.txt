Easter Island
Easter Island is located far out in the southern Pacific Ocean and has 2,000 inhabitants.
The island, which belongs to Chile, is visited by many tourists and is on Unesco's World Heritage List.
It is best known for its tall stone statues called moai.
Researchers and others have long wondered why the statues were erected back then, but no definite answer has been found.
Probably the oldest statues were erected about 1,300 years ago.
More than 600 of the statues represent heads.
Most of the heads are facing inward towards the island.
The rock where the statues were carved has also been found.
There are many half-finished statues remaining there.
Each statue must have taken a very long time to carve.
Then they were dragged from the quarry to other parts of the island where they were erected.
Some researchers believe that so much wood was used to transport and erect the statues that this is the reason Easter Island was deforested.
Perhaps this is also the reason why the island was once abandoned by those who lived there.
The island was named because it was discovered on Easter Sunday in 1722 by Dutch sailors.
