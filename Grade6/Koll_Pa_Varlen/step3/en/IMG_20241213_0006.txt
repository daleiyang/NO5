Cartography
When you have read this chapter you should know …
... how the grid is constructed.
... what time zones are.
... what different map projections mean.
The geographical grid
To describe where a place is on Earth, there are lines on the globe running lengthwise and crosswise.
Together, the lines form a grid.
The lines running from the North Pole to the South Pole are called longitudes and are all the same length.
The globe is covered by 360 longitudes.
The line just outside London, through Greenwich, is the longitude set at 0°.
Then you count 180° to the east and 180° to the west.
Longitudes indicate how far east or west a location is from the 0° longitude.
Longitudes are also known as meridians.
The lines running crosswise are called latitudes.
The longest of these lines is the equator.
It runs across the globe where it is thickest.
The equator divides the globe into two halves, the northern and southern hemispheres.
The globe is covered by 180 latitudes.
The equator is the latitude set at 0°.
Then you count 90° to the north and 90° to the south.
Latitudes indicate how far north or south a location is from the equator.
Latitudes are also known as parallels.
When describing where a place is located, you specify the longitude and latitude.
The city of Krakow in Poland is at 20° east longitude and 50° north latitude.
