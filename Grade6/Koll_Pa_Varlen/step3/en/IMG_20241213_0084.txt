Freshwater
When you have read this chapter, you should know â€¦
... what a delta is and how it is formed.
... why clean water and health are connected.
... how a shortage of freshwater can occur.
... why large lakes can disappear.
Water circulates
The total amount of water in the atmosphere and on Earth has been the same for billions of years.
All water is transported in a cycle between the sea, atmosphere, and land.
From the sea and land, water evaporates and forms clouds that fall as rain or snow over land.
The water is then transported via lakes and waterways back to the sea.
A large part of the water penetrates into the ground and accumulates in the bedrock.
This water is called groundwater.
All over the world, there are lakes and rivers with freshwater.
This is water that is important to us humans and should be sufficient for many uses.
Agriculture and industries require large amounts of water.
We also use water for transportation and to generate electricity.
There are the most lakes in areas that were once covered by inland ice.
That is why we have so many lakes in Sweden.
Through each continent, many large and small rivers flow.
The area from which the river collects its water is called the river's drainage basin.
All water from this area eventually flows into the sea.
The Amazon River's drainage basin is 13 times larger than the entire area of Sweden.
A very small part of all water on the Earth is freshwater and more than half of the freshwater is snow or ice.
97% salt water. 3% fresh water. 2% as snow and ice. 1% in groundwater, lakes and rivers.
