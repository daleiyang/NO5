Important industrial countries in Asia
Since the 1970s, many industries have shut down or moved from countries in Western Europe.
This is partly because wage costs are lower in other countries.
More and more goods we buy are manufactured in Asia.
One example is the manufacturing of clothes.
Almost none of the clothes we can buy in Swedish stores are sewn in Sweden.
Most of them are made in Asia.
It wasn't like that before.
Then almost all clothes were sewn here in Sweden.
South Korea
South Korea has developed into an important industrial country.
Initially, the country focused on manufacturing clothes for export to Europe, among other places.
Gradually, they also began to produce other industrial goods such as ships, household appliances, and cars.
The electronics industry has also grown significantly.
South Korea is one of the world's leading countries in the manufacturing of televisions, microwaves, and watches.
