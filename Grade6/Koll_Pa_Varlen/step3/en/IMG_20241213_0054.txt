Recycling
Since we know that the earth's natural resources are limited, it is important to utilize what can be.
Paper is recycled to produce new paper.
Plastic packaging can be used to make new plastic packaging or as fuel.
Plastic contains almost as much energy as crude oil.
The waste that cannot be recycled is burned in power plants and converted into heat in our homes.
Washing machines, televisions, electric mixers, and computers can also be recycled.
It is possible to take advantage of the metals found in the devices.
Metal is recycled from cables, memory cards, and even from black ink, which contains silver, among other things.
Mobile phones are profitable to recycle because they contain many different metals.
Inside a mobile phone, there is gold, silver, cobalt, and tin.
These are high-value metals that can be melted down and used over and over again.
But it is important that the recycling is done in a sustainable way.
Dangerous recycling
Today, there are industries that recycle the content of different electronic devices.
They are dismantled by hand and large amounts of chemicals are used to more easily access the metals found, for example, inside rubber cables.
This type of recycling mainly occurs in poor countries.
Environmental regulations are often lacking there, while wages are low.
Despite the fact that the work with recycling is dangerous, many are willing to do it.
Poor people do not always have a choice; they must work even if the wages are low and the health risks are high.
Glass can be recycled as many times as possible without deteriorating in quality.
Glass bottles become new bottles but also insulation panels in houses.
