Earth's coldest place.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth.
Here the lowest temperature ever, -89째C, has been recorded.
The climate is mildest at the coasts.
It is only there that the temperature can exceed 0째C during the summer half-year.
Antarctica receives small amounts of precipitation, and since the temperature almost always stays below 0째C, most of it falls as snow.
Arctic.
The area around the North Pole is called the Arctic.
Unlike Antarctica, the Arctic is not a separate continent.
A large part of the Arctic consists of a thick layer of sea ice.
The Arctic extends over the northernmost parts of Asia, Europe, and North America.
The climate in the Arctic is somewhat milder than in Antarctica.
The lowest temperature measured is -68째C.
There are more animal species in the Arctic than in Antarctica.
Here, among others, live polar bears, arctic foxes, and walruses.
There are also many permanent residents in the Arctic.
An indigenous people who have been here for a very long time are the Inuit.
In polar regions, it is particularly evident that the climate is getting warmer.
Here the average temperature has increased more than elsewhere.
An effect of this is that the ice at the North and South Poles is melting faster.
If large parts of the polar ice were to melt, sea levels could rise.
Then coastal cities worldwide are threatened by flooding.
Did you know that...
... there is no solid ground beneath the North Pole.
There is only thick ice.
... more than half of all the fresh water on Earth is stored in the ice of Antarctica.
