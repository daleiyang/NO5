The continent of South America is almost twice as large as Europe.
The border with North America follows the border between Colombia and Panama.
South America also includes several islands and the archipelagos of the Galapagos Islands and the Falkland Islands.
In western South America lies the Andes mountain range.
There are many volcanoes here, and the area is often hit by earthquakes.
In northern South America, rainforests grow, and south of the rainforest, the vast Pampas plain spreads out.
South America has plenty of natural resources.
Large quantities of minerals such as iron, copper, and tin are mined here.
Large oil reserves are found, among other places, in Venezuela.
Agriculture is also important, and the most cultivated crops are corn, wheat, and rice.
More than half of South America has a tropical climate.
In the southernmost parts, around Tierra del Fuego, and at high altitudes in the Andes, there is a polar climate.
Between these warm and cold areas is a subtropical climate.
The majority of South America's population lives along the coasts in the major cities of São Paulo, Buenos Aires, and Rio de Janeiro.
The indigenous people of South America are Indians.
There are also many descendants of European immigrants and African slaves here.
Many languages are spoken in South America, including several different Indian languages.
The largest language is Spanish, but in Brazil, they speak Portuguese.
This is because the continent was conquered by Spaniards and Portuguese in the 1500s.
