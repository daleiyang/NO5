Savanna
In the subtropical zone, the rainforest transitions into a more open landscape with grasslands, where individual bushes and trees grow.
This type of nature is called savanna and is found mainly in Africa, but also in South America, India, and Australia.
The climate of the savanna is characterized by dry seasons and rainy seasons.
During the dry season, it rains very little or not at all.
Then nature dries out.
When the rainy season comes, it often rains continuously and for a long time, and the dry nature blossoms again.
Serengeti
In Tanzania, there is one of Africa's largest national parks.
It is called Serengeti.
Here, many of the savanna's large animals live, such as lions, elephants, and giraffes.
The national park is a paradise for anyone interested in wildlife.
Every year, the park is visited by thousands of tourists.
Many come to experience Serengeti's famous animal migration during the dry season.
Then huge herds of zebras, wildebeests, and gazelles travel through the Serengeti in search of water.
The rich wildlife of the Serengeti savanna has been depicted in numerous nature films.
Did you know …
... that zebras’ stripes are probably a camouflage.
The stripes make it harder for predators to distinguish a single zebra in a large herd.
... that hippos can be aggressive, they kill more people per year than both lions and crocodiles do.
