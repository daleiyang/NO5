Time Zones
The globe is also divided into 24 time zones.
A time zone is an area on the earth where the clock is the same everywhere.
The zero point is calculated from the longitude that passes through the city of Greenwich in England.
For every 15 degrees you move east or west, you add or subtract an hour to know what time it is.
When it is 12.00 in Greenwich, it is 13.00 in Stockholm and 14.00 in Helsinki.
It is quite impractical if the time differs within the same country.
Therefore, the zone boundaries often follow national borders.
Large countries, however, are divided into several time zones.
Russia is the country with the most time zones, ten in total.
This means that when it is 12.00 in Moscow, it is 21.00 in the Kamchatka Peninsula, which is far east in Russia.
The USA and Canada are also divided into several time zones.
There is a three-hour difference between New York on the US East Coast and Los Angeles on the US West Coast.
When it is 12.00 in Stockholm, it is the same time in Angola's capital Luanda, despite the countries being hundreds of miles apart.
This is because the countries are in the same time zone.
