Oceania is the smallest continent by land area, but it extends over a very large area in the Pacific Ocean.
Australia is the largest country in Oceania and it covers an entire continent.
The second largest country is New Zealand.
Many small islands far out in the Pacific Ocean are also considered part of Oceania.
If we could travel straight through the Earth's center, to the other side of the world, we would end up in the southern Pacific Ocean.
That point is called the antipode of Sweden.
The nearest country is New Zealand.
This means that New Zealand is the country that is farthest from Sweden.
Large parts of Oceania have a tropical climate.
In Australia and New Zealand, the seasons are opposite to ours.
January is the warmest month and July the coolest.
On the South Island of New Zealand, it can snow in July and August.
European sailors came to Oceania as early as the 16th century.
From that time, large areas here became European colonies.
Many colonies did not become independent until well into the 20th century.
Australia and New Zealand belonged to the United Kingdom, and New Guinea belonged to the Netherlands.
Some areas still belong to other countries because France, the United Kingdom, and the USA have possessions in Oceania.
