Manganese nodules on the Atlantic Ocean floor.
Interest in the sea's resources is increasing.
As we consume more and more metals and land resources decrease, many scientists believe that the mines of the future will be in the sea.
This is where the extraction of rare and valuable minerals will take place.
On the seabed, especially in the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean, there are large deposits of manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt.
They lie as large lumps on the seabed and are called nodules.
Today it is possible to vacuum up the nodules from the seabed, but it is not yet economically profitable.
Arctic
Scientists believe that a quarter of the earth's undiscovered oil and gas reserves are on the bottom of the Arctic Ocean.
All countries bordering the Arctic Ocean claim the reserves, and countries do not always agree on where the borders in the sea should be.
For example, countries dispute who owns the Lomonosov Ridge, which is a mountain range on the seabed.
Another dispute concerns the small island of Hans, between Greenland and Canada.
Due to its strategic location, it can be of great significance in the search for oil, natural gas, coal, and gold.
