Population pyramids
Population pyramids make it easy to compare populations in different countries.
The pyramid is built up of horizontal bars showing the number of births over a five-year period.
On the left side, the number of men is shown, and on the right side, the number of women.
It is good to know how many people live in a country, and their age and gender.
Then one can calculate how the country's population will develop in the future.
An increased young population means that many kindergartens and schools need to be built.
An increased elderly population means that the country must invest in elderly care.
Poor country: Countries with high birth rates have a population pyramid that looks like this.
The broad base means that many children are born in the country.
This means that the population is increasing.
The narrow top shows that there are few elderly people.
Example: In Guinea, the number of girls between 0 and 4 years old is about 700,000.
Rich country: In Sweden, few children are born and the population lives longer.
The pyramid shows that there are many elderly people.
Since there are few young people in the country, the population will decrease in the future.
Example: In Sweden, the number of girls between 0 and 4 years old is slightly more than 200,000.
