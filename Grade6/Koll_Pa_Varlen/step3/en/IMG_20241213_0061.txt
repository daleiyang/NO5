Plantations.
Coffee, tea, and cocoa are crops grown on plantations.
A plantation is a farm where a single crop is grown over a large area.
The cultivation is entirely focused on sales.
Most plantations are located in countries within the tropical climate zone.
Work on plantations is mostly done entirely by hand.
In many places, working conditions are tough and wages are low.
The harvest of tea leaves is carefully weighed.
In Sri Lanka, there are several large tea plantations.
When Christopher Columbus found the sea route to America in 1492, European countries began to acquire colonies there.
The colonies were to supply the homeland with raw materials.
Countries established large plantations in their colonies.
Sugar, tobacco, cotton, and other commodities demanded in Europe were grown there.
Large amounts of cheap labor were needed on the plantations.
Therefore, slaves were brought from Africa to work on the plantations.
During the following centuries, the slave trade grew.
About 11 million people were kidnapped from their homes in Africa and shipped across the Atlantic to the colonies in America.
Slave ships were loaded with as many slaves as possible.
The ships were packed with slaves.
During the centuries that followed, the slave trade grew.
About 11 million people were taken from their homes in Africa and shipped across the Atlantic to colonies in America.
The slave ships were loaded with as many slaves as possible.
The slaves were chained together and forced down below deck.
The inhuman conditions on the ships meant that many died during the bitter journey.
In America, the slaves were sold at auctions.
No consideration was given to family ties.
Children and parents were forever separated when sold to different owners.
The slaves were then forced to work under cruel conditions and were treated very badly.
It was not until the late 1800s that slavery was abolished in America.
In many places, descendants of the African slaves still fight against oppression and racism today.
