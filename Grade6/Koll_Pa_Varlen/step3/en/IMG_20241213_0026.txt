Tropical rainforest
Around the equator, the climate is warm and humid.
Here, dense forests spread out, which are green all year round.
Since it rains almost every day, this type of forest is called a tropical rainforest.
The rainforest can be divided into different layers or tiers.
The upper layer
Most of the rainforest's plants and animals live in the upper layer.
There, the tree canopies spread out to capture as much sunlight as possible.
Monkeys, birds, and various climbing plants thrive at the top of the trees, often more than 40 meters above the ground.
The middle layer
Under the tree canopies, it is shady.
Here, palms, orchids, and lianas thrive.
The lianas grow from the ground and then climb upwards with the help of trees and bushes.
Eventually, they reach the treetops where they connect the tree crowns with each other.
The lower layer
At the ground level, the rainforest is dark and humid.
Only plants that can tolerate shade can survive here.
The vegetation is sparse and mostly consists of bushes, lower plants, and young trees.
On the ground, fallen leaves, fruits, and branches lie.
The warm climate makes them decompose quickly and provide nutrients to the soil.
Along the rivers and at the forest edges, where it is brighter, the vegetation on the ground is much denser.
