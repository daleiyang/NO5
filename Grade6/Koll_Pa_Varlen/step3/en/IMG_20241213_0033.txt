Salt desert
There are deserts where the ground is covered with salt.
In southern Bolivia, there is the world's largest salt flat, Salar de Uyuni.
Previously, a large lake was here.
When it dried out, this enormous salt desert was formed.
Every year, thousands of tons of salt are harvested from Salar de Uyuni.
The desert is also visited by many tourists who want to experience the special landscape.
Those who want can stay at a salt hotel, a hotel entirely built of salt.
Walls, floors, furniture, everything is made of salt.
Rain shadow desert
High mountains can stop moist air from reaching an area.
When the moist air is forced to rise over the mountain, it cools and begins to rain or snow.
When the air has passed the mountain, it is dry.
The area on the other side of the mountain therefore receives only small amounts of precipitation.
One can say that the area is in a rain shadow.
Rain shadow deserts are found, among other places, east of the Sierra Nevada in North America and north of the Himalayas and the Chinese mountain ranges in Asia.
Did you know...
... that the Atacama Desert in Chile is the world's driest place.
Some parts have not received rain for several hundred years.
... that the Sahara is 18 times larger than Sweden.
Oases
An oasis is a place in the desert where groundwater reaches the surface.
The landscape is green, and people and animals can live here.
Some oases are large, with entire cities, while others are just small water holes with a few individual trees.
Oases are of great importance for trade and transport through desert areas.
Caravans with goods used to depend entirely on the oases to replenish their supplies of food and water.
