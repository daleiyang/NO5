When the ground shakes
Areas located at the boundary between the earth's crustal plates are often affected by earthquakes.
The plates do not slide smoothly past each other but sometimes get hooked and stuck.
Then enormous tensions build up.
When the tension becomes large enough, the plates release from each other and they can move several meters at once.
During an earthquake, the ground shakes over a large area.
Houses can collapse, roads can crack, and people can be injured.
It is also common for an earthquake to be followed by several aftershocks.
The aftershocks can be almost as strong as the main tremor.
Tsunamis
If an earthquake occurs on the sea floor, it can create huge waves, tsunamis.
The earthquake causes large amounts of water to move.
The water, rushing at high speed, finally reaches the coasts.
Where the sea becomes shallower, a gigantic wave builds up that sweeps over the land.
The earthquake in the Indian Ocean
On December 26, 2004, a powerful earthquake occurred in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Indonesia.
The tremor caused a tsunami that swept over the shores around the Indian Ocean.
When the big wave rushed in over land, it carried away people, trees, and entire houses.
Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and India were the countries worst affected by the disaster.
Nearly 300,000 people died and several million were left homeless.
Many Swedes, who were on vacation in Thailand, were affected by the disaster.
Did you know ...
... that Japan experiences about 1,500 earthquakes every year.
... that the most powerful earthquake in Japan's history occurred on March 11, 2011.
... that Sweden also experiences earthquakes, but here they are usually so weak that they are not felt.
Earthquakes usually occur several kilometers down in the Earth's crust.
This place is called the earthquake hypocenter. From there, motion waves propagate in all directions.
The location directly above the earthquake hypocenter is called the epicenter.
