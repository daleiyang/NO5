Livestock Farming
Agricultural land is used in different ways around the world.
In some places, livestock farming is most suitable, and in other places, growing crops is the best option.
It is the climate and soil that determine what the land is used for.
From livestock, we get meat, milk, hides, and wool.
Some animals are also used as draft animals to work fields or as pack animals to transport goods.
In many places around the world, people have animals only for their own family's sustenance, which can be a few cows, pigs, or sheep.
But livestock farming can also be carried out on a large scale.
To produce milk for sale in stores, some farms may have hundreds of dairy cows.
Ranches
Cattle ranches are often located in areas where it is too dry to grow grains or other crops.
On the ranches, the animals roam freely over large areas and search for their own fodder.
This form of livestock farming does not require much labor.
Those who watch over the animals are called cowboys in the USA.
In South America, they are called gauchos.
A large part of the meat from the ranches is exported to countries all over the world.
Large areas of land with good pasture are needed to maintain such large herds of cattle.
The Pampas is a large plain in Argentina.
It stretches from the Andes in the west to the Atlantic in the east and is larger than all of Sweden in area.
Large parts of the Pampas are used as grazing land for cattle.
