Chennai
One of the world's largest cities is Chennai (Madras).
No one knows how many people live there, but the number increases every day.
The city grows unchecked outward and upward.
Every nook with a roof can become a home.
In the central parts of the city, people live in what were once public toilets.
On the rooftops, a separate city has sprung up.
Those who are not lucky enough to find a vacant spot simply have to live on the street.
Toilets are largely lacking everywhere and the water in the city's two rivers is almost stagnant with pollution.
Many years ago, hundreds of buffaloes were brought to the city as "sanitation workers."
They ate all the garbage.
Today this no longer works because of all the plastic that is thrown away.
When the buffaloes eat the plastic, they get stomach aches and become ill.
On the streets, bicycles, mopeds, cars, and buses crowd with people, cows, and buffaloes.
To reduce disruptions in traffic, city planners have decided that certain streets should be cow-free.
At the city's giant dumps, children and adults collect things that can be recycled: glass, old clothes, and plastic containers.
Many children grow up on the dump and then live their entire lives there.
Few of them can read and write.
Therefore, there are several organizations that have started night schools.
These are schools that open in the evening, where children, after a long working day, have the opportunity to learn arithmetic, reading, and writing.
