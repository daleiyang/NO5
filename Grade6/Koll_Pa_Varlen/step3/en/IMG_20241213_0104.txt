The Chinese Wall
The Great Wall of China is one of the longest structures built entirely by hand.
The Great Wall is not a single wall but consists of several different walls.
The total length is about 6,500 kilometers.
The walls are of varying lengths and widths and have been built at different times in China's history.
The first parts began to be built more than 2,000 years ago.
Much of the hard and dangerous work was done by prisoners.
The wall was built to defend China against enemies in the north.
Along the wall, there were watchposts that kept watch and warned when enemies were spotted.
Today, only a third of the Great Wall remains.
Parts of the wall have been destroyed when people took stones from it to use as building material.
Since 1987, the Great Wall has been on UNESCO's list of World Heritage sites.
