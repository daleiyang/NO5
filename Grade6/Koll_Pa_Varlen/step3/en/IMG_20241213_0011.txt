The Sun and the solar system.
In our solar system, there are eight planets that orbit the sun.
The sun is our closest star, and therefore, it appears larger and shines brighter than all other stars in the sky.
During the day, the sun's strong light makes the other stars invisible to us.
The four inner planets are quite small, with a hard surface, just like Earth.
The four outer planets are significantly larger and consist mostly of gas.
If we were to send a spacecraft to any of these gas planets, it would not be able to land on the surface but would sink into the thick layer of gas.
Between Mars and Jupiter lies the asteroid belt.
It consists of enormous rocks, gravel, and dust.
The meteorites that strike Earth often come from here.
How was the solar system formed?
Our solar system was formed about 4.5 billion years ago.
It was probably formed from a giant cloud of gas and dust that was the remnants of an exploded star.
Something caused this gas cloud to start rotating, which in turn caused it to flatten out and take the shape of a disk.
Most of the gas and dust gathered in the center of the gas disk.
Here, the gravity (gravitational force) and temperature increased, which ignited our sun.
The gas and dust that remained outside the sun clumped together over time into larger and larger spheres.
In this way, the planets of the solar system were formed.
It takes Neptune as long to orbit the sun once as it takes Earth to orbit the sun 165 times.
There could be 1,321 Earths in Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
It takes about 8 minutes for light to travel from the sun to Earth.
It is approximately 16 million degrees in the sun's core.
Previously, Pluto was considered the ninth planet, the outermost in the solar system.
In 2006, astronomers decided that Pluto is instead a dwarf planet, and since then, our solar system has 8 planets.
