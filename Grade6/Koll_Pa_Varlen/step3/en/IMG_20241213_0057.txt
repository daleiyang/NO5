Important conditions.
The climate affects what can be cultivated in different parts of the world.
Bananas and coffee grow best in a warm and humid climate.
Potatoes and rye thrive in cooler climates.
But it is not only the climate that determines what can be grown.
The type of soil also plays a significant role.
The largest agricultural areas in the world are therefore in regions where the soil is fertile and easy to cultivate.
Examples of crops grown in different climate zones.
Temperate zone: wheat, potatoes, corn, rice, millet.
Subtropical zone: citrus fruits, grapes, olives.
Tropical zone: coffee, cocoa, oil palms, bananas, cassava.
Larger harvests.
Agriculture has resulted in increasingly larger harvests in recent decades.
The harvests have increased thanks to many different aids:
Machines of various kinds – make work faster and allow larger areas to be cultivated.
Artificial irrigation – makes it possible to cultivate even in dry areas.
Chemical fertilizers – add nutrients to the soil so that crops grow better and faster.
Chemical pesticides – allow crops to withstand attacks from pests and weeds.
Since the world's population is increasing, it is good that harvests are increasing.
But it is important that aids are used correctly.
Too much artificial irrigation can lead to water scarcity and some pesticides can harm animals and humans.
