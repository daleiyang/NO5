Rice
Rice is the most important staple food for almost half of the world's population.
Most of all rice is grown in Asia.
The rice plant exists in about 7,000 different varieties, each with different characteristics.
So-called wet rice must be underwater when it grows.
Wet rice is most common in Southeast Asia.
Water is led to the fields from waterways with the help of dug canals.
Earth embankments around the fields retain the water in the rice fields.
Here most of the work is done by hand.
Despite the large cultivation of rice in China and India, they do not export much to other countries.
They cultivate mainly for their own needs.
From Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam, however, much rice is exported to other countries in the world.
When rice is grown on slopes, terraces are built to retain water in the rice fields.

In Japan, they eat 100 kg per person.
By changing (modifying) the genes of plants, plants with desired characteristics can be developed.
This can involve developing plants that withstand drought, cold, or pests better than regular plants.
Tomatoes that have been genetically modified for longer shelf life are another example.
In poor countries in Asia, many people eat almost only rice.
The unbalanced diet leads many to suffer from diseases.
Too little vitamin A can lead to blindness or even death from malnutrition.
Golden rice is a type of rice that has been genetically modified to contain beta-carotene.
Beta-carotene gives carrots their red-yellow color and is beneficial as it is converted to vitamin A in the body.
Golden rice could be a solution to the problem of malnutrition in poor countries.
