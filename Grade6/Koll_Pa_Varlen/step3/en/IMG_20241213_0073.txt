Few girls can go to school.
In poor countries, it is common for girls not to be educated.
This is because families primarily choose to educate their boys.
Girls are mostly considered an expense for the family, as they will soon marry and move to the husband's family.
A good way to combat poverty is to invest in education for girls.
The first step is to get the girls to come to school.
Therefore, some aid organizations provide bicycles to girls so that they can cycle to and from school.
Education is the best way out of poverty.
The Convention on the Rights of the Child.
There are many organizations working to stop child labor.
Unicef (UN Children's Fund) is an organization that aims to implement the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
It is also called the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
The Convention on the Rights of the Child is the children's own "law" that clearly states the rights children worldwide should have.
It states, among other things, that all children should attend school and have the right to play, rest, and leisure.
It also states that children should be protected against hard labor that hinders their schooling or harms their health.
