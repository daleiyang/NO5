The polar zone is found in areas around the North and South Poles.
Here it is cold all year round and there is little precipitation.
The cold makes the top part of the ground frozen all year round (permafrost).
In the polar zone are the Earth's tundra areas, where mostly lichens and mosses grow.
The temperate zone is located north and south of the subtropical zone.
What is typical of this climate zone is the four seasons.
In the temperate zone coniferous forests grow.
The large coniferous forest area in the northern hemisphere is called the taiga.
The subtropical zone is both north and south of the tropical zone.
Here too the climate is very warm, but it varies over the year.
In many places within this zone the year is divided into a rainy period and a dry period.
In some areas it almost never rains and there are the Earth's large desert areas.
