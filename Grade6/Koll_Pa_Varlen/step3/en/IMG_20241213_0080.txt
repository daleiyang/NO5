The sea's resources.
The sea is immensely large, and here are many important resources, including fish and shellfish.
But there is also a lot of oil and natural gas here.
Large parts of the seabed are still unknown to us humans.
Therefore, there are likely more resources waiting to be discovered.
Many want to use the sea's resources.
To prevent conflicts between different countries, it is important to agree on how the resources should be distributed.
Therefore, there are borders even at sea and rules that dictate how the sea can be used.
The rules are called maritime law and have been decided by the UN.
Borders at sea.
Each coastal country decides over its coastal area closest to land.
This area is called territorial waters and extends 12 nautical miles (about 2 miles) from land.
Here, military ships from other countries are not allowed without permission.
But since there are resources outside this zone, countries also have an economic zone that extends 200 nautical miles (about 37 miles) into the sea.
Here, the country has exclusive rights to fish, oil, and other assets.
The country may also decide how the environment should be protected here.
The rest of the sea is free and is called international waters.
No single state governs the international waters.
