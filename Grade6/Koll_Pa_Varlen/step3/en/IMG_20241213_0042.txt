Census
How do we really know how many people we are?
In Sweden, we have a long tradition of counting the country's inhabitants.
Here, all births and deaths are registered every day.
We also know how people move within the country and across the country's borders.
Therefore, we know how many people are in Sweden and where they live.
Few countries continuously keep track of their population.
The figures available are mainly based on estimates and information from schools and hospitals.
The UN wants all countries to count their population every ten years so that population figures can be compared.
But there are still countries that have never conducted a census.
An example is Sudan, which has been at war for many years.
In 2001, both China and India conducted censuses.
They showed that one in three people on Earth lives in China or India.
The result also showed that India will soon surpass China as the world's most populous country.
As early as the 1600s, priests in Sweden began making records of births and deaths.
Later, household registers were also established, where all people in the parish were recorded.
In the 1700s, the Table Office was formed, and since then we almost exactly know who has been born and died in Sweden every year.
The Census in India
In February 2001, a census was conducted in India.
To accomplish the task of counting all the country's inhabitants, 2.4 million enumerators were needed.
It is not an easy task to determine people's age, birthplace, education, and work in India.
Many do not know the day and year they were born.
Additionally, millions of people lack a fixed address; they have no home.
The homeless who slept at railway stations and sidewalks or in cement pipes were counted last.
Special enumerators were out for several weeks trying to figure out where these people would sleep that very night they were to be counted.
Compiling all the numbers was a massive task.
The result showed that the population is moving to cities at an ever faster pace.
India's population is living longer, becoming better educated, and the number of illiterates (not literate) is decreasing.
