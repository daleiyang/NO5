Labor
Some industries need well-educated labor.
Then the industry is placed near colleges, as in London and Los Angeles where there are many IT companies.
Other companies, like the textile industry, place their production where there is cheap labor.
Raw materials
Many industries are located close to the raw materials they use.
Factories that handle fish and seafood are located near ports where fishing boats unload their catch.
Many wood industries are often located near large forest areas.
Transport
The ability to transport goods in an appropriate way and at a low cost can also determine where an industry is located.
Some companies, like the pulp and paper industry, need to be close to ports because the goods are heavy and bulky.
Others are placed near major airports, such as the telecommunications industry.
Access to good rail and road connections is also important for many industrial companies.
Market
Some industries are located near large cities, for example, dairies and breweries.
In the cities, there are many people who can buy their goods.
Therefore, it's good if the production is nearby.
For companies that export goods to another country, it is often more profitable to move the entire production there.
An example of this is Japanese cars which are now both manufactured and sold in the USA.
