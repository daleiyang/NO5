Seven continents
The Earth's continents are in turn divided into seven different continents.
In addition to Australia, Oceania includes eastern New Guinea, New Zealand and a number of islands and island groups in the Pacific Ocean.
In the past, Antarctica was not considered a continent because it was thought that Antarctica was only made of ice.
That changed when geographers discovered that there was a large landmass under the ice.

In reality, it is never daytime all over the Earth at the same time.
