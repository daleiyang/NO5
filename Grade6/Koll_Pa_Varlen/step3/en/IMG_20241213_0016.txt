World's Mountain Ranges
The mountain ranges have formed during different stages in the Earth's history.
The Scandinavian Mountains and the Scottish Highlands are old mountain ranges that formed about 450 million years ago and have stopped rising.
Instead, they have been eroded over a long time by wind, water, and ice and are therefore not as high as other mountain ranges.
The Alps, the Andes, and the Himalayas are among the world's highest mountain ranges.
They are young mountain ranges that began forming about 100 million years ago.
There, mountain folding has not yet ceased.
There are large mountain ranges on all continents, but the highest mountains are in Asia and South America.
Mountain Areas
In mountain areas, the climate is completely different from what it is at lower altitudes along the same latitude.
The Pyrenees mountain range, between Spain and France, has a significantly colder climate than the surrounding areas.
The same is true in the Andes in South America.
This is because altitude above sea level affects the climate.
The higher up you go, the colder the climate becomes.
