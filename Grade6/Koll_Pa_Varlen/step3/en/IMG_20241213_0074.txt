The whole world cooperates.
A hundred years ago, most people only knew their immediate surroundings.
They knew very little about what was happening in other countries.
Today it looks completely different.
With the help of cars, trains, and planes, we can travel long distances in a short time.
Phones and the internet allow us to speak with people on the other side of the globe.
Never before has it been so easy to contact people far away.
Companies sell their products all over the world.
On the shelves of a Swedish store, you can find goods from all corners of the earth.
The size of the earth hasn't changed, but the world has, in many ways, become smaller.
Globalization is a word used to describe this development.
Companies all over the world cooperate to manufacture goods cheaply.
Different factories specialize in different products.
Here's how the production of jeans can go.
The durable fabric in a pair of jeans is made of cotton.
The cotton plant is grown in several countries, for example, Benin and Uzbekistan.
The cotton is washed and spun into threads that are woven into fabrics in countries like India and Bangladesh.
The fabric that jeans are made of is called denim.
The blue color, indigo, is manufactured, among other places, in Germany.
Previously, the blue color was extracted from the indigo plant, but today it is manufactured in factories.
It is then called synthetic indigo.
The bleaching of the blue fabric takes place in several African countries.
There are also hundreds of factories in India and Mexico that bleach fabric.
The bleaching is done to give the jeans a worn look.
This is done with pumice or chemical products.
Pumice is bought, among other places, from Turkey and Iceland.
