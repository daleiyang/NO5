Lakes
Lakes are important because they provide us with drinking water and can be used for irrigation, transportation, and fishing.
But lakes are also used for various recreational activities such as swimming, sailing, and scuba diving.
The areas in the world with the most lakes are those that were previously covered by ice sheets.
In Sweden, there are almost 100,000 larger lakes.
The country with the most lakes is Canada.
It has more than half of all lakes in the world.
The Great Lakes in North America
In North America, between the USA and Canada, there is the world's largest freshwater area.
It consists of five large lakes that are interconnected.
They were formed at the end of the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago.
Lake Superior is the largest and deepest of them, and Lake Ontario is the smallest.
Between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, the Niagara River flows with its giant waterfalls â€” the Niagara Falls.
Many people who emigrated from Europe at the end of the 19th century settled in this area.
There were plenty of natural resources here, such as coal and iron ore, and the lakes made it easy to transport goods.
From Lake Ontario via the Saint Lawrence River, there is a connection to the Atlantic.
Therefore, one of the world's largest industrial areas has grown here, with the city of Chicago at its center.
