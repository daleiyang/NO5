Water and health
The availability of fresh water in the world does not change.
The fresh water that exists must be enough for all people.
As the population increases, the amount of fresh water per person decreases at the same time.
More people must share the water.
In countries with limited access to water, a rapid population increase can create serious problems.
Lack of water can be an obstacle to a country's development and can also lead to conflicts between countries.
When countries raise their standard of living, the demand for water also increases.
Industries and agriculture must have good access to water.
People also require more water for hygiene, washing, cooking, and flushing toilets.
During the 20th century, water consumption in the world increased more than twice as much as the population growth.
Water consumption in different countries
In Sweden, each person uses an average of more than 200 liters of water per day for cooking, drinking, and washing.
That's about as much water as fits in a bathtub.
In poor countries, millions of people may have to make do with only 15 liters per person per day.
Moreover, their water is often dirty.
