How many are we?
For thousands of years, the world's population increased very slowly.
In 1820, there were 1 billion people on Earth.
After that, the world's population has increased at an ever-faster pace.
In 2012, there were 7 billion people on Earth.
In the second half of the 20th century, the number of people increased so rapidly it was described as a population explosion.
Today, the rapid increase has slowed.
The world's population is expected to increase by about 2 billion over the next 25 years.
Some areas where the population is increasing faster than others are Africa and southwest Asia.
In the countries of Mali and Yemen, each woman gives birth to an average of 7 children.
This causes the population to increase very quickly there.
In North America, Australia, and Europe, the population is increasing slowly.
In several European countries, the population is decreasing because so few children are being born.
