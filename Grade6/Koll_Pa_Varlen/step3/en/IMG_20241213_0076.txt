The World Ocean
When you have read this chapter you should know...
... how the world ocean is divided.
... what it looks like on the seabed.

Earth - a blue planet
Our planet is usually called the blue planet.
If we study the earth from space, we see that there is only one world ocean and that all land is larger or smaller islands in this ocean.
From whichever direction we look at the earth, we always see a lot of water.
We see the most water if we place the Pacific Ocean in the middle of the globe.
This picture is called the water hemisphere and consists of more than 90 percent ocean.
If we instead place Africa and Europe in the middle of the globe, we see the land hemisphere.
