... why it is important to economize on our resources.
The Water
Freshwater is usually called the world's most important resource.
Without clean water neither humans, plants, nor animals can survive.
From flowing water, we can also extract energy.
This takes place in hydropower plants, where the energy in the flowing water is converted into electricity.
The Sun and the Wind
We can extract energy from the sun and the wind.
With the help of solar cells and wind turbines, the energy is converted into electricity.
Moreover, the sun's rays are completely necessary for life on Earth.
Without the sun, the Earth would be a dead planet without life.
A resource is an asset that we humans benefit from.
There are many different resources on Earth and several of them are important for our survival.
Every day we use nature's resources in different ways.
