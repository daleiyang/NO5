Amazonas in South America is the world's largest rainforest area.
About half of all the world's rainforests are in the Amazon.
The forest covers an area more than ten times the size of Sweden.
It extends over several countries, such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.
The Amazon River
The Amazon River flows through the Amazon.
It is the world's longest river.
The river originates in the Andes mountain range and the Guiana Highlands.
More than a thousand tributaries join the Amazon River, and it becomes wider on its way to the sea.
The enormous river carries with it trees, soil, roots, and plants.
These gather in large floating islands on the river.
The islands, which can become quite large, become home to many animals and plants.
The Amazon is sparsely populated.
Most people living in the forest reside near the Amazon River.
There are many advantages to living near the river.
There are plenty of fish in the river, and it is also an important transport route.
In the dense forest, the river is often the only way to get around.
The Amazon River flows into the Atlantic.
At its mouth, the river is more than 300 kilometers wide.
Enormous amounts of freshwater (up to 300,000,000 liters) flow into the Atlantic every second.
The salinity in the sea around the Amazon River delta is therefore significantly lower than in the rest of the sea.
