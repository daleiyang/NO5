Polar areas
The polar areas are among the most inhospitable regions on Earth.
Here it is cold almost all year round.
Large parts are covered with snow and ice.
The white snow and ice reflect sunlight back into the atmosphere.
That is one reason why the climate is so cold here.
The tilt of the Earth is particularly noticeable in the polar areas.
In winter, when the Earth tilts away from the sun, it is dark all day.
Then the climate becomes even colder.
In summer, it is bright all day long.
It's called the midnight sun.
Antarctica
Antarctica is Earth's southernmost continent and covers an area somewhat larger than Europe.
Almost all of Antarctica is covered by large glaciers.
The ice is several kilometers thick in many places.
Antarctica is the only continent on Earth where there are no permanent residents.
The cold climate means only plants and animals that can endure the extremely harsh climate survive here, such as mosses, lichens, penguins, and seals.
The Earth's axis tilts, causing the northern and southern hemispheres to receive varying amounts of sunlight during different parts of the year.
When we have winter in the northern hemisphere, we are on the part of the Earth tilted away from the sun.
In the southern hemisphere, it is the opposite; it is summer, because that part of the Earth tilts towards the sun.
When it is winter in Sweden, it is summer in Australia, and vice versa.
