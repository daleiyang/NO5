Conic projection
Here, the paper is shaped into a cone placed on the globe.
Where the cone and globe meet, the map is correctly represented.
This means that the area around the equator and the northernmost area are best depicted.
But there are large errors in the area between.
Round globe or flat disc?
Already two thousand years ago, geographers knew that the Earth was a round globe.
They could even calculate the Earth's circumference.
But during the Middle Ages, the Earth was no longer depicted as a globe.
Then, the Earth was thought of as a disc, and it was considered dangerous to reach the edge of the Earth's disc.
With the explorations during the 1500s, the Earth began to be depicted as a globe again.
More than two thousand years ago, cartographers tried to transfer information from a round globe to a flat map.
As long as sea voyages were not very long, the lack of precise distances was not a major problem.
When explorations began and journeys became longer, the old maps also became unusable.
