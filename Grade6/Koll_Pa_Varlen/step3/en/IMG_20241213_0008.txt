Map projections
It is difficult to transfer information from a round globe to a flat map.
A flat map always gives, in one way or another, an incorrect picture of the earth's surface.
The larger the area depicted, the greater the errors in terms of distances, angles, and areas.
Therefore, world maps have more errors than a map of a small area.
There are different methods used when the earth's surface is to be depicted on a map.
They are called map projections.
Imagine placing a paper in different ways over the globe and then tracing.
The map's appearance varies depending on how the paper is placed.
Cylindrical projection
The depiction is accurate at the equator where the paper cylinder and globe meet.
The countries that are in the middle of the map, along the equator, therefore look correct when compared to the globe.
The further towards the poles, the greater the inaccuracies.
The areas near the poles become greatly enlarged.
Greenland therefore always appears larger than in reality.
Sweden appears about as large as Sudan, but in reality, Sudan is five times larger than Sweden.
