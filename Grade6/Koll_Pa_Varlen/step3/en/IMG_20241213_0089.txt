Lake Victoria
Lake Victoria is Africa's largest and the world's third-largest lake.
The lake is located at the equator and borders the countries of Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda.
The area around the lake is one of the most densely populated in the world, with over 100 million people living here.
This is due to the pleasant climate and the abundance of fertile agricultural land.
The area is even considered one of the world's most fertile regions.
Lake Baikal
Lake Baikal in Russia is the world's deepest inland lake.
The lake's bottom has not been fully mapped, but the greatest depth measured today is 1,940 meters.
Because Lake Baikal is so deep, it contains enormous amounts of freshwater.
Here lies one-fifth of all the freshwater in the world.
Lake Baikal is also one of the world's oldest lakes and has a unique plant and animal life.
Many of the lake's plant and animal species exist nowhere else in the world.
One of the few seal species living in freshwater, the Baikal seal, is found here.
Caspian Sea
Despite its name, the Caspian Sea is a lake, a saltwater lake.
It is also the world's largest inland lake.
The Caspian Sea borders both Europe and Asia.
The rivers that supply the lake with water, including the Volga and Ural, are important transport routes.
Through the Volga, the countries around the Caspian Sea connect with Europe.
Oil and natural gas are extracted here.
From Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, quantities of oil and natural gas are shipped to Europe.
There is also plenty of fish in the lake, including sturgeon.
From the sturgeon comes Russian caviar, which is highly sought after and sells for more than 100,000 SEK/kg.
An inland lake with high salt content in the water is called a salt lake.
Lakes without outlets usually have salt water.
The water becomes salty because the water evaporates while the salt remains.
The Caspian Sea, the Dead Sea, and the Great Salt Lake are large saltwater lakes.
