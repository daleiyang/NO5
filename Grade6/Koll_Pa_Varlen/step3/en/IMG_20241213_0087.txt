The Nile.
The Nile is the world's second longest river.
It winds more than 6,500 kilometers through the desert.
For Egypt, which consists of 94 percent desert, the river is vital.
More than 40 million people are entirely dependent on the river's freshwater.
On both sides of the river, there is a narrow strip of land that yields rich harvests in an area that would otherwise be impossible to cultivate.
Where the river flows into the Mediterranean, a green triangle is clearly visible in the middle of the desert.
This is the Nile's enormous delta.
The Nile Delta is one of the world's most densely populated areas, with more than 2,000 inhabitants per square kilometer.
The Nile's triangular delta is clearly visible on satellite images.
Delta (Î”) is the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet.
In ancient times, the Greeks thought that the mouth of the Nile had the same shape as the letter and therefore called the mouth delta.
The Mississippi River flows into the Gulf of Mexico, near the city of New Orleans.
The delta, called the Birdfoot Delta, extends far into the sea and has formed over thousands of years.
It is the currents in the sea that have helped shape the delta so that it looks like a bird's foot.
Fertile Floodplains.
It was on the fertile floodplains that agriculture developed 10,000 years ago.
Here people settled, became sedentary, and learned to cultivate the wild plants that existed in the area.
Early river cultures emerged along the world's major rivers: the Nile, Euphrates, Tigris, Ganges, and Indus.
Since the rivers provide good conditions for agriculture, transport, energy, and fishing, people still live densely on the floodplains, although there can sometimes be significant flooding.
