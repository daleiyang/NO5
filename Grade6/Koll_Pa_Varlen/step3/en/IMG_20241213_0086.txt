Rivers
A river slowly changes the landscape it flows through.
It usually starts in a mountainous area and then flows towards the sea.
On its journey, from the source to the sea, it carries amounts of stones and gravel with it.
The eroded material is called sediment.
The faster the water flows, the larger the river is, and the looser the soil it passes, the more sediment the river carries with it.
Delta
A delta forms where a river flows into the sea.
When the river meets the sea, the flow rate decreases, and the sediment settles to the bottom.
The heaviest and coarsest stones sink first and are deposited closest to the land.
Further out, the finer sediment slowly settles to the bottom.
Over the years, the water depth outside the river mouth decreases, and new land is formed.
The area where the river meets the sea is constantly shifting outward, and the river becomes longer.
The sediment that rivers carry into the delta areas is very fertile.
The river that carries the most sediment is the Ganges-Brahmaputra, which flows into the Bay of Bengal.
The river consists of two major rivers, the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which originate in the Himalayas.
It is the sediment from the mountain range that has built up the colossal delta area that today forms most of the country of Bangladesh.
Scientists who have studied satellite images of the delta area have calculated that the river creates seven square kilometers of new land each year.
A delta forms where a river meets the sea.
Deltas are built up over long periods and take on different shapes depending on the seabed configuration, wave strength, sea currents, and tidal fluctuations.
