The ocean must be protected.
Not long ago, the ocean was thought to have infinite capabilities to handle all the waste we humans wanted to get rid of.
Since trash sank to the bottom and was not visible, many thought it simply disappeared.
There was also a belief that the ocean's resources would never run out.
Today we know that it was wrong to think so.
Trash and environmental toxins do not disappear, and several marine animals and plants are close to extinction.
Food from the sea.
Today, one out of five people is fed by food from the sea.
As the number of people on Earth increases, fishing methods have become increasingly efficient.
Large well-equipped fishing fleets are outcompeting local fishermen.
They locate fish with sonar and then vacuum the sea floor with large trawls.
This type of fishing has become increasingly common.
Some fish and shellfish are in higher demand than others, such as giant prawns and bluefin tuna.
The bluefin tuna is being driven to extinction due to its popularity.
It is one of the world's most liked seafood, especially in Asia.
Other countries where dishes like sushi and sashimi have become popular also demand tuna.
The high price causes tuna to be caught despite the ban.
The demand for giant prawns has had other consequences.
They are not being driven to extinction, but their natural habitats, mangrove forests, are.
The forests are cut down to make way for large shrimp farms.
