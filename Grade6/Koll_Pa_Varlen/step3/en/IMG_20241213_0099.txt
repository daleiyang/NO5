Lemurs and chameleons are some of Madagascar's unusual animals.
Madagascar
Madagascar is a large island off the east coast of Africa.
Here there is a completely unique animal and plant life.
Some animals and plants cannot be found anywhere else on Earth.
One of Madagascar's most famous animals is the lemurs.
They are only found in Madagascar and a few islands in the same area.
Lemurs are a kind of monkey that live in the rainforest.
There are different types of lemurs, but common to all is that they live together in groups.
Another animal in Madagascar is the chameleons.
These lizards are known for being able to change color.
Previously it was thought that chameleons changed color according to the background, but that is not the case.
Instead, it is the chameleons' mood and the temperature of the air that determine the color.
Previously the whole of Madagascar was covered with forest.
During the 20th century, large parts of the forest were cut down and today barely a tenth remains.
If Madagascar's unique animal and plant life is to remain in the future, the forest must be protected.
Did you know ...
... that the researchers listened to the Beatles song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" when they found Lucy (hence her name).
... the word lemur means the spirits of the dead.
Maybe the lemurs got their name because of their ghostly eyes.
Next to the pyramids is the Sphinx, which is another gigantic structure.
A sphinx is a pharaoh with a lion body.
The Sphinx in Giza is about 20 meters high and carved from a single rock.
