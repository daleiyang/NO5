Destructive forces
The building forces are counteracted by forces that break down the Earth's surface.
Another word for destructive forces is erosion.
Weathering
If water freezes into ice in cracks in the bedrock, the rock can explode.
It is common in mountainous areas where it is cold.
Rocks can also break apart when plant roots penetrate cracks and widen them.
This is called the rock weathering.
Another form of weathering can occur where the bedrock contains limestone.
The limestone can dissolve if exposed to water containing acids.
Then cracks and cavities form in the rock.
This type of weathering has created fantastic caves with beautiful stalactite formations.
Wind, water, and ice
Wind, water, and glaciers are other forces that wear down and change the Earth's surface.
The wind can move sand and soil from one place to another.
The sand that follows the wind can also wear on rocks so that their shape changes, but it is, of course, very slow.
Coasts are changed by the constant movements of the waves.
In some places, the waves have shaped cliffs and caves.
In other places, the waves move sand and build up long sandy beaches.
Flowing water also changes the landscape.
It erodes parts of the ground so that deep grooves form.
The water carries the eroded material to the river's mouth where a delta forms.
(Read more about deltas on page 88.)
Glaciers can create entire valleys.
The large and heavy ice masses shape the landscape by eroding and grinding down the rock.
