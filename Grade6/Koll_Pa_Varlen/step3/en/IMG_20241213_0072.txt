Child Labor
Child labor is a problem that exists in many parts of the world.
The main reason children are forced to work is poverty.
In many countries, it is difficult to prohibit child labor because it helps families have a better livelihood.
In rural areas, it has long been a tradition for children to help with work within their own families.
Many children work with sowing, plowing, harvesting, and tending livestock.
They also watch children, clean, and cook so that parents can work.
But children also work outside the home, sometimes alongside their parents.
They work in industries, in mines, and on plantations.
Many perform hard work and are forced into long workdays with low pay.
Interviews with working children show that many want to continue working to support their families.
But they want to work fewer hours, receive better pay, and have better working conditions.
Going to school a few hours a day is also high on the wish list.
Unfortunately, few children have their wishes fulfilled.
Asia accounts for the largest proportion of child workers, followed by Africa and Latin America.
But no one knows how many children work because most countries have laws prohibiting child labor.
Therefore, much work is done "secretly".
The UN estimates that about 270 million children work instead of going to school.
