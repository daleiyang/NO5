The Panama Canal
The Panama Canal runs through the country of Panama in Central America and connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean.
It is one of the largest and most difficult construction projects ever undertaken.
It took eight years to build the 80-kilometer-long canal, and it was completed in 1914.
It is expensive to sail through the Panama Canal.
A typical price is around 500,000 kronor.
Yet it is one of the world's most trafficked canals.
About 13,000 ships pass through here each year.
Before the canal existed, ships were forced to round the southern tip of South America via Cape Horn.
A ship sailing from, for example, New York to San Francisco saves 13,000 kilometers and several days by going through the canal instead of rounding Cape Horn.
Passing through the Panama Canal takes only 8 hours.
The largest ship that has passed through the canal was 300 meters long and 33 meters wide.
New York
New York is the largest city in the USA by population.
Many of the city's inhabitants have their origins in other countries.
Therefore, it is often said that New York is the most international city in the world.
There are large groups of Jews, Italians, Chinese, and Irish here.
Some parts of New York have names like Chinatown and Little Italy.
The center of New York is located on the island of Manhattan.
The UN has its headquarters here, and in the northern part is the large Central Park.
The street grid in Manhattan is rectangular, and almost all blocks are square.
The streets running north-south are called Avenues, and those running east-west are called Streets.
Most streets have a number, such as 5th Avenue or West 96th Street.
Broadway, known for its theaters and shows, is a street that breaks the pattern and runs diagonally across almost all of Manhattan.
