Why is there hunger?
How is it that there are still so many people in the world who are starving?
It is not possible to give just one explanation for this.
People can suffer from hunger or starvation for several different reasons.
Poverty: It is clear that hunger and poverty are connected.
A person who is poor simply cannot afford to get the food he or she needs.
As many as 800 million of the world's 850 million starving people live in a poor country.
Natural disasters:
Floods, tropical storms, and droughts are other reasons why people starve.
Today, drought is considered the main cause of food shortages in the world.
In many places, climate change will lead to the problems worsening in the future.
War:
Hunger is also common in areas affected by war.
War forces many people to flee from their homes and work.
This in turn makes it difficult for them to get the food they need.
Ensuring that people suffer from food shortages can also serve as a weapon in war.
This can happen by wells and fields being bombed or people being forced from their homes.
Social injustices:
A large part of the problem with hunger is that the world's resources are unfairly distributed.
In India, for example, tons of rice, vegetables, and fruits are grown.
At local markets, large quantities of fresh fruit, vegetables, and rice are offered.
Yet India is one of the countries with the highest number of starving people.
Low wages and poor working conditions mean that many people cannot buy the food they need to be full every day.
About 10 million people die each year from starvation.
This corresponds to approximately as many people as live in Sweden.
25% of the world's starving are children.
Hunger is more common among women than among men.
