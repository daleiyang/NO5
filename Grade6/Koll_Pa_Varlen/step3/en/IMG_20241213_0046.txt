Big cities
In the past hundred years, more and more people have moved from the countryside to cities.
This is called urbanization.
Today, more than half of the world's population lives in cities.
The population is increasing so rapidly that we talk about megacities, metropolitan areas with more than 10 million people.
Examples of megacities include Mexico City, New York, and New Delhi.
Why do so many move to cities?
The dream of a better life can come true in cities.
There are more ways to make a living there than in the countryside.
Many poor people work by offering small services; they sell flowers, cigarettes, and newspapers or wash car windows at red lights.
This type of work is very common in cities in poor countries.
Large slum areas
More than 1 billion people live in urban slums today.
Most often lack water, sewage, garbage collection, and electricity.
Slums are everywhere: along railways and rivers, in alleys and around airports.
Slums are near areas where rich people live and adjacent to city dumps.
