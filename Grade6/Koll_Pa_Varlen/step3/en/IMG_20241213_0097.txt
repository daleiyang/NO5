Africa is the world's second largest continent.
More than 1 billion people live in Africa, yet the continent is sparsely populated.
Less than half of the population lives in cities.
That is few compared to Europe.
Africa is the warmest continent, as most of it lies in the tropical climate zone.
Around the equator, it rains a lot and a large rainforest area spreads out.
Further north, where the climate is significantly drier, lies the Sahara, the world's largest desert.
Africa is often called the cradle of humanity.
This is because the first humans probably lived in East Africa.
Here, skeletons of early humans over 3 million years old have been found.
The oldest skeleton was found in Ethiopia in 1974.
It is the bones of a woman who lived about 3.2 million years ago.
Scientists named her Lucy.
Most African countries have been colonies.
Europeans began exploring Africa in the 16th century.
They soon realized what resources the continent had.
Here there was plenty of iron, gold, and diamonds.
This eventually led to a race among several European countries to seize as much territory as possible.
The United Kingdom, France, Portugal, and Germany were the countries that acquired the most colonies.
At the beginning of the 20th century, almost all of Africa was under European rule.
It was not until after the end of World War II in 1945 that the colonies began to become free.
