Desert
In the desert, it can be a very long time between rains, sometimes several years.
The dry climate means that few animals and plants can survive here.
In some deserts, there is no vegetation at all.
Most of the world's deserts are located at the tropics.
This is because the air is particularly dry there.
People often think of deserts as warm places, but not all deserts have a warm climate.
The Gobi Desert in Asia is an example of a desert with a cold climate.
Sahara
The Sahara in Africa is the world's largest desert.
Large parts of the Sahara are sandy deserts with fine sand packed into large sand dunes.
The appearance of the desert is constantly changing as the wind moves the sand from one place to another.
Sometimes strong sandstorms sweep over the Sahara.
The winds can carry the sand hundreds of miles away.
But the Sahara is not just sand.
Large areas are covered with rocks and cliffs.
The extreme climate means that the Sahara is sparsely populated.
The climate in the desert
Because the air is so dry in the desert, the sun shines from an almost constantly cloudless sky.
The sun's rays quickly heat up the ground.
This causes the temperature to rise sharply during the day.
In the Sahara, daytime temperatures can rise to over 50°C.
When the sun goes down, the temperature drops and the ground quickly becomes cold.
At night it can be around 0°C.
