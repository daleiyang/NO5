Why are some countries poor?
Why are some countries poorer than others?
There are many reasons for this; a single explanation is not enough.
Many poor countries have been colonies and ruled from other countries.
In some cases, this has delayed economic development.
Several poor countries have been ruled by a dictator who was not interested in building up the country.
Sometimes, the poverty is due to prolonged wars or the country suffering from drought or other recurrent natural disasters.
