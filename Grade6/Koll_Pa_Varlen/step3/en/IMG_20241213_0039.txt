The area around the Gulf of Mexico is often hit by hurricanes.
The image shows Hurricane Katrina heading towards New Orleans.
In the middle of the whirlwind, the eye of the hurricane is visible.
It is an area in the center of the hurricane where it is significantly calmer than in the rest of the hurricane.
To allow meteorologists to distinguish different hurricanes, they are given different names.
Initially, all hurricanes were given female names, but since 1979 every other hurricane has been given a male name.
The names are in alphabetical order.
The hurricane after Katrina was called Lee and the hurricane after Lee was named Maria.
Tornadoes
Another type of whirlwind common in North America is tornadoes.
They are much smaller than hurricanes, but can still cause significant damage.
A tornado usually occurs in connection with thunderstorms and forms up in the atmosphere when the air is warm and humid.
Under the cloud, something resembling a funnel forms, reaching down to the ground.
A tornado only affects the area it moves over.
Therefore, one can be quite close to a tornado without being harmed.
Tornadoes are most common in the USA, which is hit by about 1,000 of them each year.
A tornado leaves a trail of destruction behind it.
It is not uncommon for a house to be completely destroyed while the neighboring house remains largely undamaged.
Strong whirlwinds also occur in Sweden.
Here, they are not as strong and are called tromber.
