The world's largest industrial country
The USA is the world's largest industrial country and a wide variety of goods are manufactured here.
The largest industrial area is located in the northeastern part of the country.
Other important industrial areas are located in California and Texas.
In the USA, there are large industries manufacturing computers, pharmaceuticals, and space equipment.
Producing these products requires extensive research and technical knowledge.
This is something companies and universities in the USA invest in, and therefore these industries are growing fastest.
In Detroit, Henry Ford started the first mass production of cars in 1903.
The Model T was manufactured according to the assembly line principle and soon became a sales success.
Detroit then became the center for automobile manufacturing in the USA.
But in the past 30 years, the automobile industry has closed factories.
People have been forced to move from the city due to unemployment.
The space shuttle Atlantis has just launched.
Northeastern USA
The industrial area in northeastern USA extends from Boston on the Atlantic coast westward to Chicago.
The largest industries here have been the automobile, iron, and steel industries.
Many industrial sectors have been severely affected by closures, and major industrial cities like Pittsburgh and Chicago have lost many jobs because of this.
The reasons for the closures are several.
Perhaps the most important reason is that other countries, especially in Asia, have been able to manufacture products that are both cheaper and better.
