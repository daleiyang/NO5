If you compare poor and rich countries, you can find some areas that usually differentiate them.
These are the economy, health, life expectancy, literacy, and infant mortality.
Rich countries
- good economy
- good healthcare
- high life expectancy
- high literacy
- low infant mortality
Poor countries
- poor economy
- worse healthcare
- low life expectancy
- low literacy
- high infant mortality
Rich countries are also called industrialized countries or developed countries.
Poor countries are also known as developing countries or underdeveloped countries.
But even in the poorest countries, there are rich people, and vice versa.
In the USA, one of the world's richest countries, there are still many people who cannot afford healthcare.
In India, a country with a lot of poor people, there are also many rich people living a life of luxury.
Nolberta Malara in El Salvador borrowed $30 to buy a sewing machine.
In 2006, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Muhammad Yunus from Bangladesh.
He started a bank that lends small amounts, microloans, to poor people.
Almost everyone who borrows money from the bank is a woman.
Since they are poor and own nothing of value, they cannot borrow money from regular banks.
Microloans help borrowers start businesses from which they can then earn money.
It may happen that a woman borrows money to buy a mobile phone.
Then she rents it out to those who do not have a phone and thus earns an income.
Another example is a woman who borrows money to open a small street stall where she can sell various items to earn money.
Thanks to microloans, people have a chance to escape poverty.
Almost everyone who borrows money repays their loans with interest and can continue to support their families.
In other words, it has been good for both the bank and the borrowers.
The bank has over 1,000 branches around Bangladesh.
Today, many other countries have adopted the idea of microloans.
