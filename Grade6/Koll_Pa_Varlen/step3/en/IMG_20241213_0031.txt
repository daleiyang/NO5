Steppe
The steppe is an intermediate between savanna and desert.
There are almost no bushes and trees here, only large open grass steppes.
The open nature often makes it windy in the steppe areas.
The prairies in North America and the Pampas in Argentina are some of the world's largest steppe areas.
Other large steppes are found in Mongolia, South Africa, and northeastern Australia.
In some places, large parts of the steppe are cultivated, while other steppe areas are too dry to allow cultivation.
Ecotourism
Ecotourism involves trips organized so that the nature, animals, and people in the area are not harmed.
The economic surplus from tourism, among other things, goes to investments that help the local population.
This may include contributions to schools, orphanages, and water supplies.
Tourism also creates jobs for people in the area.
Prairie
The prairie is a vast plain that stretches east of the Rocky Mountains in North America.
Today, most of the prairie is cultivated, but originally there was a vast grassland area.
Many Native American tribes lived here and hunted bison.
In the mid-1800s, European settlers began to settle on the prairie.
They cultivated the land, which led to wars and conflicts with the Native Americans.
The Native Americans were increasingly pushed aside and forced to live in designated areas (reserves).
Meanwhile, the settlers began an intense hunt for bison.
In a few decades, 40 million bison were killed and only a few hundred remained.
Today there are significantly more bison on the prairie because they live protected in reserves.
