We must manage our resources
Sustainable development
The term sustainable development means that we who live on Earth must manage the Earth's resources so that even future generations can benefit from them.
Everyone must ensure that water and air are not polluted, forests are not destroyed, and farmland is not ruined.
It is primarily the people in rich countries who need to change their way of living, as they use up the most resources.
At the same time, poor countries must improve without their way of living negatively affecting the environment.
It is a difficult task, and governments of the world's countries must cooperate to find a good solution.
Where is energy consumed?
The consumption of energy differs greatly between continents and between countries.
The rich countries consume a lot of energy.
Here, industries and cities use large amounts of energy produced using coal, oil, or uranium (nuclear power).
In poorer countries, it looks different.
There are fewer cars, industries, and oil products, and therefore significantly less energy is consumed.
The image shows Earth's energy consumption.
The yellow light comes from cities, and the red light shows areas where oil is extracted.
Off the coast of Japan is visible a green-blue light.
It comes from ships fishing for squid.
The faint pink light is large forest fires, and the blue band over Greenland and North America is the aurora borealis.
The image is a photomontage - in reality, it is never night all over the Earth at the same time.
