New Zealand
New Zealand has 4.3 million inhabitants and is about half the size of Sweden.
The country consists of two larger islands, the North Island and the South Island, as well as some smaller islands.
The climate and nature on the South Island are very similar to Norway, with high mountains and fjords along the coast.
On the North Island, the climate is warmer.
There is the capital Wellington, but Auckland is the largest city.
New Zealand has belonged to Great Britain.
Therefore, English is the official language along with Maori.
Maori is the language of the indigenous people.
Much of the Maori's old way of life and language was destroyed when the British came to the islands in the 1830s.
Many Maoris died due to wars and diseases brought by the British.
Now their situation has improved, and their culture is accepted.
The Maori war dance, Haka, is used today by the New Zealand rugby team before matches.
More than half of New Zealand's area is pasture.
Agriculture is important, and the country exports wool, meat, and dairy products.
In Sweden, we can buy apples and kiwis from New Zealand.
The kiwi bird is a symbol of New Zealand.
It cannot fly.
