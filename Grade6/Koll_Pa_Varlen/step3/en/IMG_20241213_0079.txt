Coasts
The coast consists of a narrow land strip and the shallow sea outside.
This is where the large fish stocks in the sea are located.
Fish thrive along the coasts where there is plenty of food in the nutrient-rich deep-sea water that flows to the surface.
Almost 90 percent of all fishing in the world occurs in coastal areas.
There are also large deposits of oil and natural gas along the coasts.
Countries with long coastlines, such as Norway, have become very wealthy thanks to their fishing and large deposits of oil and natural gas.
Land and sea meet at the coast.
The land extends into the sea and underwater.
It is relatively shallow here, only about 150-200 meters deep.
The area is called the continental shelf.
This is where most of all fishing takes place.
There are also large deposits of oil and natural gas here.

The continental slope dips sharply towards the deep sea.
The depths of the oceans are largely unexplored.
We actually know more about what the moon looks like than what is hidden deep in the sea.
In the deepest parts, it is pitch black.
No sunlight reaches down there, and the pressure is so high it would crush a human.
Despite that, there is a whole world of strange animals here.
Luminous jellyfish, transparent fish, and eels with enormous mouths live more than 1,000 meters deep in the sea.
Some of the animals are very large.
The enormous giant squid can be 20 meters long and weigh 1 ton.
The squid's eyes are as big as plates so that it can see better.
Despite its size, it is one of the world's least known animals.
This is because it is very shy and almost never comes to the surface.
