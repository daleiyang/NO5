When the food is not enough
In our part of the world, there is a great abundance of food.
At the same time, there are millions of people in other parts of the world suffering from starvation.
The problem is that food is so unfairly distributed.
A large portion of the starving people live south of the Sahara in Africa and in southern Asia.
Starvation is decreasing
About 850 million people in the world suffer from starvation.
Despite the high number, starvation has actually decreased somewhat since 1990.
The UN has set a goal to halve the number of starving people in the world by 2015.
This will happen through many different measures, including increasing and improving aid from rich countries to poor countries.
