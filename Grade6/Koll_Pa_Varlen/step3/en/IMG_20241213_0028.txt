The world's rainforests are shrinking.
Today, logging is one of the great threats to the rainforest.
Large forest areas are logged to make way for agriculture and pasture.
But the trees are also used for fuel and to produce paper and furniture.
Teak and mahogany are two types of wood from rainforests that are popular for use in furniture.
The soil layer in the rainforest is thin and nutrient-poor.
The nutrients come mainly from fallen leaves, branches, and fruits that decompose.
Therefore, the trees are very important.
Their roots hold the thin layer of soil firmly.
When the trees are cut down, heavy rains can wash away the soil, making the land even more nutrient-poor.
When large areas are completely clear-cut, there is a risk that the forest will never recover.
It also becomes difficult for the forest's animals and plants to survive.
Some species risk being completely extinct.
The deforestation of rainforests is progressing quickly.
In the past hundred years, half of all rainforests have disappeared.
Today, some rainforests are protected in national parks and nature reserves, but it is difficult to protect all forests in this way.
Today, oil palms are cultivated in large areas where rainforests once grew.
Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm.
It is used in baked goods and chips, as well as in cosmetics, soap, and lubricating oil.
When rainforests are cleared to make way for oil palms, the natural habitat for forest animals and plants disappears.
This makes it difficult for them to survive.
The FSC label.
The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is an organization that ensures that timber products come from forestry that does not harm the environment.
Their label can be found on some garden furniture and barbecue charcoal, for example.
