Landfills as a workplace
In poor countries, recycling takes place every day but in a completely different way than we are used to.
In the corners of the big cities' streets, all the garbage is thrown into large piles.
They are taken to massive landfills where poor people live and work sorting the trash.
Because there is an opportunity to make money from the garbage, large slum settlements have grown around the landfills.
The world's largest landfill, Smokey Mountains, is located on the outskirts of Manila in the Philippines.
More than 3,000 people live and work there.
The landfill is several kilometers long and has become a city within a city.
There, both children and adults search through the garbage that hundreds of trucks dump every day.
On a good day, a person can earn about 10 Swedish kronor by collecting things that can be recycled.
It can involve anything from newspapers and glass to old clothes and plastic cans.
When the long workday is over, buyers come and pay for the sorted garbage which is then transported to industries where it's converted into new products.
