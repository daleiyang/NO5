Canada
Canada is the world's second largest country, but only 35.5 million people live here.
Most live along the border with the USA.
Large parts of northern Canada are uninhabited wilderness.
The nature is very similar to the Swedish, and many animals and plants are the same.
Very large areas are national parks to protect certain animals, such as bison and polar bears.
Tourism to these remote areas has increased, and many come here to fish, hike, and canoe.
In Canada, English and French are spoken.
French is used by 25 percent of the population.
In some areas, for example in the province of Quebec, almost everyone speaks French.
Many Canadians also have French names.
The prevalence of French in the country is because Canada was a French colony for 160 years, until 1763.
Then the country belonged to Great Britain for almost 200 years.
In Canada, many people like ice hockey.
The most famous ice hockey league is the NHL (National Hockey League) which has the world's best ice hockey players.
Teams come from both Canada and the USA and the final winner wins the Stanley Cup.
