Different types of bridges



On this page you can see some examples of different types of bridges.



Can you see what durable forms have been used in the different bridges?



The arch bridge is an older type of bridge. It was made of stone. 



The Romans built many bridges and aqueducts in this way. 



The girder bridge is the oldest type of bridge, which used to be made of logs. 



Today, the beams are made of steel or reinforced concrete.



Truss bridges are usually built with steel trusses. 



The arch bridge is a bridge where the load-bearing parts are shaped like an arch.



The suspension bridge is suspended by thick steel cables. 



The cables in turn are suspended from large towers called pylons. 



The cable-stayed bridge is a type of suspension bridge. 



However, the cables of the bridge are obliquely strung directly from the pylons to different locations on the bridge.
