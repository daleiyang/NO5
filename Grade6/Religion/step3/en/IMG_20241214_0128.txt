Family and friends participate in the wedding ceremony.
They wish the couple a happy life together.
WEDDING
According to some Buddhists, marriage and getting married have nothing to do with religion.
But it is common to go to a monastery after the ceremony for monks to bless the marriage.
A wedding ceremony can look different.
It depends on the country and the group.
The important thing about the wedding is to be blessed and encouraged to live in love for each other and others.
FUNERAL
There are many different ways to conduct a Buddhist funeral.
But usually family and friends gather with a monk who reads texts near the deceased.
According to Buddhism, a person needs help moving on to the next life, and the texts the monk reads help the deceased.
Sometimes the body is placed in a coffin and buried in the ground.
Sometimes it is cremated.
Blessed means being protected by God.
Cremation means burning a body so it becomes ash.
