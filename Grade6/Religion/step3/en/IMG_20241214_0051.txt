The story of Moses
Another story that is important for Jews is the story of Moses.
It is about how the Jewish people left Egypt and returned to Canaan.
Back to the land that Abraham had received from God a long, long time ago.
As long as Joseph lived, his family did well in Egypt.
Joseph's family grew and became a great people, the Jewish people.
But after a while, Joseph died and a new pharaoh came to power in Egypt.
He wanted to build great pyramids and needed many workers for the construction.
Therefore, he made the Jewish people his slaves.
Moses in the reeds
Since the Jewish people were large, the pharaoh was constantly afraid they would revolt against him.
He therefore decided that all newborn Jewish boys should be thrown into the great river Nile.
One of the boys who was born during this time was named Moses.
His mother refused to throw him into the river.
Instead, she placed him in a basket that floated on the water.
After a while, the pharaoh's daughter came down to the river.
She found Moses, who had floated into the reeds, and she decided to take care of him.
