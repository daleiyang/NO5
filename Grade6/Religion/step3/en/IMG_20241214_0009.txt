Inside the church
In this picture we see several things that are usually found in churches.
On this board, numbers are posted for the songs to be sung during the service.
The songs are called hymns.
All hymns have a number and are collected in a hymn book.
There is another board on the other side.
It's so everyone in the church can see the numbers of the hymns.
If you look closely, you can also see the numbers used to put up on the boards.
Can you find them?
The altar is called the big table in the middle with flowers on it.
The altar is meant to remind of the table where Jesus had his last meal with his friends.
The priest stands at the altar when he or she leads the service.
