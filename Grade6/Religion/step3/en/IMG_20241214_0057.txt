From child to adult.
According to Jewish belief, boys and girls stop being children when boys are 13 and girls are 12.
This means they must start taking responsibility for what they do and know what is right and wrong.
The boys and girls then take a course in the synagogue where they learn about the Jewish faith.
They also learn to read the Jewish Bible in Hebrew.
At the end of the course, a ceremony is held which is called bar mitzvah for boys and bat mitzvah for girls.
At the ceremony, one gets to show that they have learned to read the Jewish Bible in Hebrew.
Afterwards, a big celebration is held.
A ceremony is a solemn moment where one reads texts and perhaps sings songs.
