Important ceremonies
Baptism
Baptism is one of the most important Christian ceremonies.
Then the baptized becomes part of the Christian church and the Christian faith.
Baptism is a ceremony found in all Christian churches around the world.
In baptism, the person is blessed by God.
It means that he or she receives protection and help from God.
Many believe that a child receives its name in connection with baptism, but that is not true.
The child has already been given a name by its parents.
The priest only uses the child's name during baptism and says: I baptize you ... (name) in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
God is sometimes called the Father and Jesus the Son.
In some churches, children are baptized when they are young; in other churches, adults are baptized.
Those who baptize small children do so because it was done in the time when Jesus lived.
Then whole families were baptized at the same time.
Those who baptize adults want the baptized to decide for themselves if they want to be baptized.
At a child's baptism, the priest pours water on the child's head.
When an adult is baptized, sometimes the whole body is immersed.
A ceremony is a solemn moment where one reads texts and perhaps sings songs.
A blessing is to receive protection and help from God.
