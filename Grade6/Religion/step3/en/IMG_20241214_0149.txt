The Religion of the Sami
The Sámi are called the people who early settled in Sápmi in northern Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Russia.
The Sámi land in Sámi is called Sápmi.
No one knows exactly when the Sámi came to Sápmi, but it was probably more than 5,000 years ago.
The area is called Sápmi or Sameland.
Today there are about 100,000 Sámi in the Nordic countries.
36,000 of them live in Sweden.
Nature Has a Soul
In the belief that the Sámi had long ago, nature was alive and holy.
Nature had a soul.
Some places and objects were holier than others.
A stone that looked special or a mountain that was higher than others was believed to contain extra power.
These places and objects were called seitar.
At these seitar, the Sámi made sacrifices to the gods.
The sacrifice could consist of reindeer blood.
Holy means that something is divine and special.
It is also something that is very important.
Seitar are sacred objects that contain great power.
