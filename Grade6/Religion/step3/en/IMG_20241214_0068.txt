This is a mosque.
This is called the place where Muslims gather to pray to God.
The word mosque means "a place where one prays".
This mosque is located in Stockholm.
Next to a mosque there is always a tall tower called a minaret.
From there, it is called out when it is time for prayer.
In the past, there was always a man who walked around the tower and called out loudly when it was time for prayer.
He was called a muezzin.
Today, it is most common for there to be a tape recorder or a CD player that plays the prayer times.
At the top of the minaret sits a crescent.
It is a symbol for Islam.
