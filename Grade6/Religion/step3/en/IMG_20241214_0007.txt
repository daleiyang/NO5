Christianity is the world's largest religion.
It started with a man named Jesus, who wandered around the country of Israel and talked about God.
That was more than 2,000 years ago.
Christians believe in one God.
They also believe that Jesus was the Son of God.
Jesus taught people how to connect with God.
He taught them how they should live and that people should love each other.
Jesus is also called Christ and those who believed in him were therefore called Christians.
The religion was named Christianity.
When we count years, we start with the year Jesus was born.
In the year 2000, it was thus 2,000 years since Jesus was born.
Now even more years have passed since then.
A church is called the place where Christians gather to hold worship.
The word church means the Lord's house and the Lord is the same as God.
The one who leads the service is called a priest.
This church is on Iceland.
It is easy to see that it is a church because there is a cross on the roof and one at the entrance.
The cross is an important Christian symbol.
A church is always positioned so that the entrance faces west.
This means that the wall with the four large windows faces north.
In the past, the northern wall did not have windows.
It was because people believed that evil, the unpleasant and dangerous, came from the north and they wanted to keep it out.
On the southern side, there were almost always windows.
It was because the light came from the south.
In the past, there were no lamps, only live candles.
Then it was important to let in the light that came from the sun.
Today, churches often have windows on both sides.
