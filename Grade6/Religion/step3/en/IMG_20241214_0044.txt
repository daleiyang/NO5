Men and boys wear a kippa.
The father and sons in the family have a special, thin cloth cap on their heads.
It is called a kippa.
In ancient Jewish texts, it is stated that all Jewish men and boys should cover their heads to show respect to God.
The most common is that they wear a kippa, but it's also fine with a hat or a cap.
Some Jews use a kippa every day while others only wear it on special occasions.
It can be when they go to the synagogue or pray.
JEWISH FOOD
Jews who closely follow their religion only eat food that is kosher.
This means that the food follows Jewish rules about what food can be eaten.
The rules are based on ancient Jewish books and traditions from several thousand years ago.
The rules state that Jews must not eat horses, pigs, or hares.
But they can eat sheep, cows, and deer if the meat is slaughtered by a specially trained butcher.
Jews can eat sea creatures that have scales, like fish.
But they are not allowed to eat shellfish and octopuses because they have no scales.
Another important rule is not to mix meat with food containing milk, cream, or cheese.
If you eat meat for dinner, you must not drink a glass of milk with it.
To ensure that meat and dairy products are never mixed, Jewish kitchens have double plates and cutlery.
This is what a kippa might look like.
A kippa is a type of cap that Jewish boys and men should wear.
Kosher is the food that follows the Jewish rules about what can be eaten.
