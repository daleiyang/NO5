The gods are important
Throughout the history of Hinduism, belief in gods has been important.
Some Hindus believe in many different gods.
Others believe there is only one god with many different names.
Hindus believe there are many ways to reach the gods and so one can believe and live a little differently.
There are three gods who are especially significant.
1. Brahma, who creates the world.
2. Vishnu, who ensures the world functions.
3. Shiva, who destroys the world so that it can be recreated by Brahma.
The god Vishnu always wears a helmet or crown.
In one hand he holds a conch shell.
He uses it like a trumpet.
The god Brahma has four faces.
He holds four books called the Vedas.
There all human knowledge is collected.
