The Christian faith
Christians believe in God.
They believe that God has created the world, people, and animals, yes, everything that exists.
According to Christian belief, God can be described in three different ways.
1. The first is as the Father.
Then one thinks of God as the creator of the world, people, and animals.
God is described as a father who takes care of his children.
2. The second is as Jesus, who is also called the Son of God.
God wanted to connect with people on earth and chose to show himself as a human, and that was as Jesus.
3. The third is as the Holy Spirit.
The Spirit is God's power that helps people and does good.
The Spirit is everywhere in an invisible way, just like the wind.
The wind is not seen but still exists.
What we see is what the wind does.
It makes trees sway and things fly around.
This kind of triangle is found in most churches.
It shows that God can be described in three ways but is still the same God.
One corner is the Father, one corner is Jesus, and one is the Holy Spirit.
The triangle has three corners, but all the corners are part of the same triangle.
In the same way, God has three sides but is one and the same God.
Jesus - Son of God
Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God, which means that he is the same as God.
At the time when the Bible was written, people believed that a child was a copy of their parents.
A son was like his father and a daughter like her mother.
Jesus was called the Son of God because he was like God.
Jesus told people about what God wanted and about how God is.
He said, for example, that God is just and loving.
