Moses helped the Jewish people to escape.
But when Moses and the Jewish people had set off, Pharaoh regretted it.
He sent his best soldiers after the Jews to bring them back.
When the Egyptian soldiers approached, Moses stood with his people in front of a large sea.
What would they do?
There was nowhere to escape.
They were trapped between the sea and the soldiers.
God then told Moses to lift his staff over the sea.
Moses did as God said.
Then the water opened and the Jewish people could walk through it.
On both sides, the water stood like a wall.
The soldiers followed through the water, but when the Jews reached the other side, God let the water flow back.
The Egyptian soldiers were then drowned by the huge floods.
The people arrived in Canaan.
The Jewish people were finally free!
They began to walk towards Canaan, and after a very long journey, they finally returned to the land God wanted them to live in.
What do you think?
Pharaoh forced the Jews to work for him.
Have you ever been forced to do something?
Is it ever right to force someone to do something?
