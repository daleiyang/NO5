For a Protestant, the sermon about God is the most important in worship.
Therefore, there is always a pulpit in Protestant churches.
A pulpit is a small "balcony" where the priest stands when he or she gives a sermon.
The pulpit is positioned so that everyone in the church can see and hear the priest well.
Protestants
Another large group of Christians is called Protestants, and they belong to the Protestant church.
Protestants are found all over the world, especially in Europe and the USA.
The Protestant church was formed in the 1500s by a man in Germany named Martin Luther.
Martin Luther was a monk in the Catholic Church, but he did not like how the Pope managed the church.
He protested against the Pope and was therefore forced to leave the Catholic Church.
In protest, he formed a new church free from the Popeâ€™s power.
It was called the Protestant church.
In Sweden, the Church of Sweden is an example of a Protestant church.
The Protestant church has two sacraments.
There are several things that differentiate the Protestant church from the Catholic church.
It does not have monasteries with monks and nuns, and it is not governed by any pope.
It also has no saints, because Martin Luther believed people should pray directly to God, not through saints.
In the Catholic Church, there are seven sacraments, but in the Protestant Church, there are only two: baptism and communion.
This is because Luther only included the sacraments he could find in the Bible.
According to him, only baptism and communion are described in the Bible.
Here, a priest gives communion to a young girl.
