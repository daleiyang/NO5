Ganesha is a god who protects.
In Hinduism, there are many stories about gods.
One story describes how the god Ganesha was born.
Ganesha is a god that many Hindus like very much.
Ganesha protects the home.
Almost all Hindus have pictures of him on their home door.
When you get married, you ask him for a blessing.
And when you go on a journey, you pray to him for the journey to go well.
The goddess Parvati really wanted a child who would protect her against intruders.
But her husband Shiva did not want that.
Once, Shiva went on a long journey.
Then Parvati decided to have a child on her own.
She scraped some skin from her body when she was bathing and then shaped it into a small figure.
Then she brought the small figure to life.
The years passed and the little child, who was named Ganesha, grew up.
Every day he watched outside his mother's room.
One day Shiva came home.
He had been away for several years and now wondered who it was standing outside his wife's room.
Shiva challenged Ganesha and cut off his head.
Parvati became very angry and sad when she saw what Shiva had done.
She explained to Shiva who Ganesha was.
Shiva regretted it and immediately sent one of his aides to find a new head for Ganesha.
He would take the head from the first creature he met.
It happened to be an elephant.
Ganesha was brought back to life, but now he had an elephant head.
To receive a blessing from a god means you get the god's protection.
An intruder is a person who breaks into someone's, e.g., a burglar.
