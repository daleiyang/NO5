People are divided into groups.
For several thousand years, people in India have been divided into different groups called castes.
All people belong to a caste.
Each caste has its specific rules for how people should live.
Today, not all people follow these rules, but in one context they do.
And that is when one is getting married.
Almost no one marries a person from another caste.
In the newspaper, one can announce whom one wants to marry and always mention which caste the person must come from.
One cannot change caste.
A person is born into a caste.
A child belongs to the same caste as the parents.
It is not possible to change caste during life, but the caste can change in the next life.
There are four main castes.
Priests belong to the highest caste.
Those who are to serve and help others belong to the lowest caste.
Nowadays, the law states that no one should be treated unfairly for belonging to a lower caste.
Hindus often have a dot on the forehead.
The color of the dot used to show which caste a person belonged to.
Today, it is mostly decoration.
A red dot can also mean that one is married.
Castes are the groups that people in India are born into and belong to for their entire lives.
