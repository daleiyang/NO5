BEFORE AND NOW
Christmas food - then and now.
When Swedes celebrate Christmas, food is very important.
Even in the past, Christmas was a time when one could eat good food.
There were established traditions for how and when the food should be prepared.
Two weeks before Christmas, a pig was slaughtered.
Then one got a lot of fresh meat to make food and sausages from.
Bread and gingerbread were baked.
Around Lucia, the Christmas baking began.
Then bread was baked in the shape of pigs and Christmas goats.
A little over a hundred years ago, it became common to have saffron in the bread.
Then they started making Lussekatter.
Around that time, it also became common to bake gingerbread in the form of hearts, pigs, and gingerbread men.
Before that, gingerbread was mostly eaten as medicine if you had a stomach ache.
Many traditions remain.
The tradition of eating special Christmas food still exists today.
Many dishes contain pork, such as Christmas ham, sausages, meatballs, and jellied meat.
But there are also other dishes associated with Christmas.
Lutefisk, various types of cabbage, rice pudding, and pickled herring are examples of food that many eat at Christmas.
In the past, winter apples and hazelnuts were the most common Christmas candy.
Today, a lot of chocolate, caramel, and brittle are eaten at Christmas.
This is how a Christmas buffet could look in the past.
The dishes were filled with sausages and bread, and in the middle stood a pig's head.
This is how a Christmas buffet can look today.
Ham, herring, and jelly are common dishes.
