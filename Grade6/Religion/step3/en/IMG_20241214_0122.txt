Mara sent raging winds that blew sand into Siddharta's eyes.
But nothing could make him stop meditating.
Siddharta becomes Buddha
During the night, Siddharta realized the truth about life.
Then he became Buddha, which means "the enlightened one" or "the one who has understood."
After that event, he was called Buddha.
So what did he realize?
Well, he concluded that the best way to live is the middle path.
You should live life moderately.
Siddharta himself had tried living in luxury and abundance in the palace.
He had also tried living as an ascetic and almost not eating anything.
But he did not become happier from that.
He then concluded that the best is the middle path between these.
Buddha also said that the reason people are unhappy is that they constantly want things.
Therefore, the meaning of life is to practice not wanting a lot of things, but to be content with what you have.
What do you think?
Buddha says that the middle path is best and that one should not exaggerate.
Do you agree?
Isn't it good to live in luxury and abundance?
