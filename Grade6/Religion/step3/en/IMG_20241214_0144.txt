WHAT HAPPENED AFTER DEATH?
The most important of all the gods was named Odin.
He lived in a place called Valhalla.
The bravest of men could go there after death.
There they could feast together with Odin.
In Valhalla there was a pig named Särimmer.
It was slaughtered every day and eaten.
But, every evening, Särimmer lived again and could be slaughtered again the next day.
On Valhalla's roof stood a goat eating the branches of Yggdrasil, the world tree.
From the goat's udder came a good drink and those who lived in Valhalla loved to drink it.
Those people who did not come to Valhalla went to the underworld.
It was a cold and unpleasant place ruled by the goddess Hel.
All children and women went there, but also the men who had not been heroic.
