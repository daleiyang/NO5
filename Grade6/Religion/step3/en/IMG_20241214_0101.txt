The story of Rama and Sita.
A popular story in India is about a hero named Rama.
Rama was a prince but also a god.
Once, Rama and his younger brother Lakshmana visited a king named Janaka.
The king had a daughter named Sita.
She was very beautiful, and men came from all over the country to propose to her.
King Janaka wanted Sita to marry a strong and good man.
Therefore, he decided that all suitors should undergo a test to see if they were strong enough.
The king had a big bow that he had received from the gods.
The man who could string the bow would marry Sita.
Rama thought Sita was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen, so he decided to try to string the bow.
Rama succeeded and married Sita.
After the wedding, they moved to Rama's home and lived happily together.
Rama and Sita move to the jungle.
After a few years, Rama and Sita moved to the jungle.
Rama's brother Lakshmana went with them.
They would live in the jungle for 14 years because Rama's father had decided so.
One day, Sita saw a golden deer that she became very fond of.
Rama and Lakshmana started chasing the deer to capture it for her.
In the meantime, the evil demon Ravana kidnapped Sita.
He took her to his kingdom and held her captive on an island.
There he tried to persuade Sita to marry him.
But she refused.
Sita was sure that Rama would come to save her.
Rama was so strong that he broke the bow.
