Jewish Easter (Pesach)
When? In the spring, in March or April.
Why? To remember when the Jews fled from slavery in Egypt.
How? The Jewish Easter is a celebration that lasts for eight days.
It is usually celebrated with family or close friends.
The first two evenings, Jews eat a festive meal with certain special dishes.
One of them contains small pieces of horseradish.
Horseradish tastes very strong and the strong taste is meant to remind of how the Jewish people suffered as slaves in Egypt.
It is also important to have compassion for all Egyptians who died when Pharaoh did not want to let the Jews leave Egypt.
During the entire Easter, unleavened bread is eaten.
Unleavened bread is bread that has not been allowed to rise.
Such bread is eaten to remember that when the Jewish people fled from Egypt, they were in such a hurry that their bread did not have time to rise.
The festival is sometimes called the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
Unleavened bread is the same as unfermented bread.
Yeast makes a bread airy.
An unleavened bread becomes flat.
