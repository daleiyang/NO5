Moses was tasked with helping the Jewish people.
Moses grew up and the Jewish people were still slaves in Egypt.
God saw how badly the Pharaoh treated them and decided to ask Moses to help them.
One day when Moses was in the desert, he saw a bush that was burning.
Strangely enough, the bush did not burn up!
Moses became curious and went closer.
Then he heard God's voice from the bush.
God commanded Moses to take the Jewish people and leave Egypt.
When Moses approached the burning bush, he heard God's voice.
The Pharaoh refused to let the Jews go free.
Moses went to Pharaoh and told him what God had said.
But the Pharaoh did not believe him and instead made the Jews work even harder as slaves.
God became very angry when the Pharaoh did not want to let the Jews leave Egypt.
As revenge, he let Egypt suffer various plagues.
God turned the Nile's water into blood.
Darkness afflicted the land.
Animals became sick and died, and locusts and mosquitoes plagued the Egyptians.
But nothing made the Pharaoh change his mind and let the Jews escape slavery and leave the country.
Then God let the last and worst plague strike Egypt.
God went to every house where Egyptians lived and killed the eldest child in each family.
Even the Pharaoh's own son was killed.
To protect the Jews, God had told them to smear lamb's blood on their doors.
Then God knew that Jews lived there and in those houses, he did not kill anyone.
When the Pharaoh saw the Egyptians' grief over all the dead children, he realized he had to do as God wanted and let the Jews be free.
God turned the river's water into blood and let millions of locusts plague the Egyptians.
