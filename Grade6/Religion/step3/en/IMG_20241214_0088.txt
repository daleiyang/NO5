Some Muslims hold firmly to old traditions.
Both among Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims, there are people who adhere strongly to old rules and traditions.
Within both groups, there are also people who do not.
Adhering to old traditions is more related to where one comes from than whether one is Sunni or Shia Muslim.
For example, those who come from poor countries and live in rural areas are often more bound to old traditions than those who live in cities.
A tradition that is important for all Muslims is to wash before prayer.
One washes feet, hands, arms, face, and head.
Preferably, one should pray together with others and not be alone.
