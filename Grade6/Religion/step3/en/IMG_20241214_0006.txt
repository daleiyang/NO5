In every religion there are groups.
You can have slightly different beliefs within the same religion.
Therefore, there are always different groups.
The differences between the groups can be large, even though they belong to the same religion.
The groups usually look like this:
● One group strictly believes in all rules and traditions and does not think that the religion should change at all.
Everything should be as it was originally when the religion was created.
● Another group believes that some of the old faith must be abandoned, as it belongs to another time.
The people in such a group mix the old and the new.
● In a third group, people believe that most things should be adapted to today's society.
The religion can change, but the most important core of the faith must remain.
MOST RELIGIONS HAVE BEEN RUN BY MEN.
In almost all religions in the world, it is the men who have had power and been high leaders.
It is the men who have led the services and decided which sacred texts should be read.
The holy books also mostly concern men.
Why has it been like this?
One reason is that religions are very old and it was like this in the societies where the religions grew.
Women took care of the children and the home.
When they went to the religious buildings it was as visitors.
Today it is a bit different.
Women can be leaders.
They can lead services and read texts.
But it is still mostly men who govern.
Even though the religious texts mostly concern men, many believe it does not matter much.
Questions about the meaning of life and how to treat other people are more important.

Do you think there is any difference in how much space the girls and boys take up at your school?
Who decides the most?
Or do the girls and boys decide equally?
