Rama frees Sita.
Rama and Lakshmana became very angry when they noticed that Sita had been abducted.
They immediately set off to look for her.
They were helped by the monkey god Hanuman, who commanded a whole army of monkeys.
Hanuman tried to find the hiding place where Ravana had locked Sita.
He brought Rama's ring so that Sita would know he was a friend.
But Hanuman was captured, and Ravana decided to set fire to his tail.
Hanuman then took the opportunity to set fire to all the buildings in the city with his burning tail, except the palace where Sita was held captive.
Then he fled.
Rama and Hanuman then attacked Ravana.
Ravana had ten heads and was very strong.
They defeated him and cut off all his ten heads.
Rama was reunited with Sita.
The good had triumphed over evil.
Now Rama returned home from the jungle and became king of the land.
A demon is a creature, an evil spirit, that does wicked things.
WHAT do you think?
This story, among other things, is about the good always triumphing over evil.
What do you think yourself?
Is it always the good that wins?
Can it sometimes pay to do things that aren't really good?
