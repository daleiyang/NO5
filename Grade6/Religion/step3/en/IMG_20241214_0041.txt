Inside the synagogue.
In this picture, we see several things that are usually found in synagogues.
This is a podium.
There stands the one who speaks in the service.
That person is called a rabbi.
The podium can also be called the pulpit.
On the front, there are three Stars of David.
The person whose back we see is the cantor.
The cantor leads the service with singing and reading from the Jewish Bible.
