When Maya woke up, she wondered what the strange dream meant.
She therefore asked some dream interpreters for help.
They said that the dream meant she would have a son and that he would become an important man.
He would either become a famous king or a famous religious person.
Siddharta was born and grew up
After a while, Maya gave birth to a boy named Siddharta.
The father wanted the son to become a famous king, just like he was.
Therefore, he didn't want the son to face any difficulties.
That could make him contemplate the meaning of life and other religious questions.
Therefore, Siddharta was allowed to grow up in luxury and abundance.
The parents protected him from all terrible things and he was never allowed to leave the palace where they lived.
When Siddharta became an adult, he was allowed for the first time to go outside the palace.
Then he took his horse and carriage and drove away.
After a while, he arrived at a park where he saw a very old man limping forward.
Siddharta had never seen an old person before.
For the first time in his life, he found out that all people eventually grow old.
Siddharta was shocked and immediately went back to the palace.
