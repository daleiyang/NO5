Different Muslim groups.
There are over a billion Muslims in the world, which means over 1,000 million Muslims.
They live all over the world.
What all Muslims have in common is the strong belief that there is only one God, that God wants peace, and that people should live together and help each other.
Most are Sunni Muslims.
Most Muslims identify as Sunni Muslims.
This group makes up almost 90% of all Muslims.
Sunni Muslims place great importance on Sunna.
Sunna are the habits and traditions that Muhammad had.
Sunni Muslims believe that Muhammad learned everything from God that a person needs to know.
Therefore, they try to live as Muhammad lived.
This can include how Muhammad washed and took care of his body.
It can also include how he distributed his inheritance to his children and wives.
It may also include how work should be divided between men and women.
Shia Muslims.
About 10% of all Muslims in the world identify as Shia Muslims.
When Muhammad died, Shia Muslims wanted a different leader than the Sunni Muslims.
For Shia Muslims, it was important that the leader was related to Muhammad.
This was not the case for Sunni Muslims.
Since then, there have been two groups among Muslims: Sunni and Shia.
Sunna refers to the habits and traditions that Muhammad had.
