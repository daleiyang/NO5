Catholics believe in saints.
Saints are people who have lived a particularly good and loving life.
It is the Pope who decides who becomes a saint.
It happens after such a special person has died.
In a Catholic church, there are statues or pictures of saints, and people light candles and pray by them.
People do not pray to the saints but pray for the saints to help them pray to God.
Saints are very important to Catholics.
Monks and nuns.
In the Catholic Church, there are monks and nuns.
Monks are men, and nuns are women.
They have chosen not to marry or have children.
They want to live life solely with God in mind.
They pray a lot, work, help the sick and poor, and dress simply.
Anyone who chooses to become a monk or nun promises to be so for life.
Monks and nuns live in buildings called monasteries.
Statues or pictures of saints are found in all Catholic churches.
People often light candles in front of them.
This nun helps children play instruments.
A monk (man) and a nun (woman) are people who live in a monastery to concentrate as much as possible on God.
A monastery is a building where monks and nuns live.
