Jesus said that one should love their enemies.
Jesus spoke about how important love for God and people is.
Much of his message evoked strong feelings.
He said, for example: "Love your enemies and pray for them."
Many thought that was difficult.
Jesus often returned to the point that we should not judge each other, for then we ourselves will be judged.
Everyone makes mistakes sometimes, so show love and understanding instead, said Jesus.
The priests became angry with Jesus.
When a person does something wrong, it can be called sinning.
Jesus forgave people their sins.
But according to the priests in the temple, only God could forgive sins.
Therefore, the priests became angry with Jesus who claimed that he could do that too.
They accused him of blasphemy.
Blasphemy means speaking ill of God or placing oneself above God.
The priests wanted to get rid of Jesus and therefore invented that he was planning to rebel against those in power in the country.
After a while, the priests succeeded in having Jesus imprisoned.
People listened to Jesus.
He said it is important to show love and understanding.
