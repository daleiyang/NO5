Judaism
Pharaoh dreamed a special dream.
The released prisoner worked for Pharaoh for a couple of years.
But then one night Pharaoh dreamed something strange.
He dreamed of seven fat and fine cows grazing in the grass.
Then came seven lean and ugly cows and ate the fat cows.
Pharaoh wondered what the dream meant.
He sent for all the wise men in Egypt, but no one could understand the dream.
Pharaoh's servant then thought of Joseph whom he had met in prison.
He was good at interpreting dreams!
The servant told Pharaoh about Joseph.
Pharaoh immediately sent his soldiers to the prison to fetch Joseph.
Then he told him about the dream.
Joseph explained the dream to Pharaoh.
Joseph immediately understood what the dream was about.
First, there would be seven good years.
The harvests would be good, and everyone would have plenty of food.
Then would come seven hard years, and then there would be a shortage of food.
Pharaoh was very grateful that Joseph could interpret the dream.
For now he could help his people.
Pharaoh gave Joseph the task of collecting food during the good years so that the people would have food even when the bad years came.
Joseph worked hard and became a powerful man in Egypt.
