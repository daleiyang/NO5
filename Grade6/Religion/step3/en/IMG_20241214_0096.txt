Hindus do not eat meat.
Many Hindus eat vegetarian food.
That means they do not eat meat.
This is because Hindus believe that all living beings have a soul.
This soul is reborn in a new being after death.
So when, for example, a person dies, their soul is reborn into something new.
Some people are reborn as new humans and some are reborn as animals.
Therefore, killing an animal is something one should not do.
A soul is a person's personality.
Hindus believe that when the body dies, the soul continues to live.
