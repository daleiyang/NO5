Where does the name Judaism come from?
The name Judaism is ancient.
About 3,000 years ago, Jews lived in groups in the land of Canaan.
One of the groups was called Judah, after Jacob's son Judah.
The part of the country where they lived was called the Kingdom of Judah, and those who lived there were called Jews.
That later gave the name Judaism.
Fruit from the Tree of Knowledge
Adam and Eve ate a fruit from the Tree of Knowledge in Eden.
Many artists have painted pictures depicting Adam and Eve when they eat the fruit.
The fruit is often painted as an apple.
But the Bible doesn't say anything about what kind of fruit it actually was.
