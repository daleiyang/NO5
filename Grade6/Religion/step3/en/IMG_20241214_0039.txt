Judaism.
Judaism is an ancient religion.
It began with a man named Abraham who lived almost 4,000 years ago.
According to Jewish belief, God gave Abraham a land called Canaan.
Abraham and his family moved there.
They lived there and became what we today call the Jewish people.
Jews believe that there is one God and that it is God who has created everything that exists: the world, humans, and animals.
Jews also believe that we humans have an important mission on Earth.
Humans are meant to take care of animals and plants.
We should also love each other.
There are not so many people who are Jews today.
There are only about 18 million Jews in the whole world and that is not many compared to other world religions.
But Judaism is a very important religion.
This is partly because it is the foundation of Christianity and Islam.
