Muslim chronology
In order to know when things have happened, we count the passing years.
In Sweden, we follow the Christian calendar, which starts from the year Jesus was born.
When we say the year 2000, it means it was 2000 years since Jesus was born.
This chronology is used in large parts of the world, even in Muslim countries.
But there is also a Muslim calendar.
It starts from the year when Muhammad moved from Mecca to Medina.
The year we call 2000 was the year 1421 according to the Muslim calendar.
– Oh, so Muslims count the years differently.
– Yes, the Muslims' year 1421 was the year we called 2000.
