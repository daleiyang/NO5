Important ceremonies.
FROM CHILD TO ADULT.
According to Islam, children can start praying themselves at the age of seven and from the age of ten they can accompany to the service in the mosque.
This can be done by children without any special courses or ceremonies.
When a child transitions from child to adult, he or she should begin to take responsibility for trying to distinguish between what is good and what is evil.
More is expected of an adult than of a child.
MARRIAGE.
It is very important to marry and enter into marriage according to the Quran.
Marriage contributes to the good functioning of society.
According to Islam, a man can marry four women, but a woman cannot marry several men.
A man who marries several women must treat them equally and fairly.
Many Muslims feel that it is not possible, because one will always favor someone, and then it will not be fair.
That is one reason most Muslim men do not live with more than one woman.
In Sweden, it is prohibited to be married to more than one woman, and this also applies to Muslims.
But in other countries like Iran and Pakistan, it is allowed.
