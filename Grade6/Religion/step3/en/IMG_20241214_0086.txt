The black building in the middle is the Kaaba.
The Kaaba is the temple that Abraham and Ishmael built in Mecca.
During the pilgrimage, Muslims should walk around the Kaaba seven times.
4. The fourth pillar is fasting.
For an entire month, one refrains from eating, drinking, and smoking during the day.
Only when it gets dark in the evening does food start to be prepared.
The month in which this occurs is called Ramadan.
One reason Muslims fast is to honor God and think of him.
Another reason is so that those who are not poor can feel what it's like to be without food.
The sick, children, the elderly, and pregnant women do not need to fast.
5. The fifth pillar is the pilgrimage.
The most important place in the world for Muslims is the city of Mecca.
There, one makes a pilgrimage.
The pilgrimage happens at a certain time every year, and 2â€“3 million people gather in Mecca.
They meet to pray and do the same things that Muhammad did the last time he was in Mecca before he died.
Among other things, they walk seven times around the Kaaba.
They also visit a mountain outside the city and sacrifice sheep, which are then eaten at a large concluding feast, the festival of sacrifice.
Ramadan is the month when Muslims fast.
A pilgrimage is a journey to an important religious site.
