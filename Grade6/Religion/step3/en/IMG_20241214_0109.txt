Everything goes in circles.
According to Hinduism, life goes in circles.
Humans are reborn over and over again to new lives on earth.
And the world is recreated over and over again.
This is called samsara, which means eternal cycle, something that never ends.
But humans can escape these circles and break the cycle.
Many believe that one then becomes part of a divine force called Brahman or reaches the gods one has prayed to.
Some believe that one reaches their ancestors and can live with them.
What we do matters.
For a Hindu, it is important to live rightly, to think and act lovingly.
Everything one does matters for this life and what happens in the next life.
What one does is called karma.
Karma is the sum of all good and bad actions a person does in their life.
They determine what one is reborn as in the next life.
It is not certain that one will be human in the next life; one can also become an animal.
If the karma is good, one is reborn into a good life, and vice versa.
