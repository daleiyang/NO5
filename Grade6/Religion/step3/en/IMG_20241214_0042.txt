At the very back of the picture, you see a fabric hanging.
It is black with a gold frame.
Behind the fabric, there are large scrolls with texts from the Bible.
The scrolls are brought out during the service so that the cantor can read from them.
These are Hebrew letters.
Hebrew is the religious language of Judaism.
It is used, for example, when praying and singing.
This candlestick has eight lights.
It is used during a holiday called Chanukah.
Hanukkah is celebrated in December and then one candle is lit each day for eight days.
In Swedish, Chanukah is called the temple inauguration festival.
