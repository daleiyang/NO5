The prince and his family had to move.
Vessantara had many animals.
One of the finest animals was a white elephant.
The elephant was very special.
It could do something that ordinary elephants could not.
It could make it start raining.
This was very good for the country's farmers when the sun had shone for a long time and they needed rain on their fields.
But one day the prince gave away the elephant.
Everyone living in the country got angry with him.
Prince Vessantara was then forced to move to another country.
The only ones who went with him were his wife and his two children.
In the new country, the prince gave away his family
Prince Vessantara and his family traveled away.
One day Vessantara met a man who needed slaves.
Then he gave his two children to the man.
Then he gave his wife to another man who asked if he could have her.
But this man was a god who had transformed himself.
When the god had Vessantara's wife, he returned her again.
The god then explained that all the other gods were very pleased with Vessantara.
As a reward for being so generous throughout his life, Vessantara would get back everything he had given away.
For a Buddhist, it is important to be unselfish
The story of Prince Vessantara is a bit unusual.
The prince gives away everything he has, even his wife and his children.
But Buddhists like the story because one of the most important things for them is to be unselfish and to think a lot about their fellow human beings.
What do you think?
Prince Vessantara gives away almost everything he has.
Do you like giving things away yourself?
When is it fun to give away?
