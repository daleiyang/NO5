Adam - the first human
The first human that God created was named Adam.
Adam was given the task to take care of the earth.
When God created Adam, the angels became jealous.
God then told them that it was He who decided and that they should accept Adam.
All the angels did so except Iblis, the devil.
Iblis refused to accept Adam.
Adam and Eve broke God's rules
Adam was given a wife named Eve, and together they lived in a beautiful garden, a paradise.
God told them that they could eat from all the fruits in the garden, except the fruit from a special tree.
If they did, they would sin.
Iblis, the devil, tricked Adam and Eve into eating the forbidden fruit.
Then God became angry and told Adam and Eve that they could no longer live in the paradise.
They would instead have to work very hard on earth to survive.
Adam asked God for forgiveness
Adam asked God for forgiveness.
But Adam and Eve were not allowed to return to the paradise.
After all, they had done wrong and had to take their punishment.
But God said that if they believed in Him and prayed to Him, He promised to protect them.
They would not need to be afraid or sad.
But if they did not pray and believe in God, they would instead have a very hard time.
Compare the Muslim creation story with the Jewish and Christian.
They are quite similar!
