The Black Stone
In Kaba, there is a special stone embedded.
This stone is black.
A story tells that the stone was originally white, but it has turned black because many people have not done as God wanted.
Instead of obeying God, they have sinned.
The color of sin is black.
GOD COMMANDS ABRAHAM TO SACRIFICE ISMAEL
One night Abraham dreamed that God wanted him to sacrifice his son, Ismael.
This was very difficult for Abraham, but he knew he had to do as God wanted.
The devil tried to get Abraham not to obey God.
But Abraham threw stones at the devil, who then disappeared.
Then he prepared to sacrifice his son.
Abraham placed Ismael on the ground and prepared to kill him.
But then God called to him to stop himself.
God said: "You have already carried out the command you received in the dream."
God had tested Abraham to see that he was faithful to God.
Abraham had passed the test and God was very pleased.
Abraham was grateful to keep his son and instead sacrificed an animal to God.
The point of the story of Abraham and Ismael is that one must always do as God wishes, no matter how terrible it is.
But if one trusts in God, everything will work out and be good.
Abraham thought it was very difficult to sacrifice his son, but he knew he had to do as God wanted.
What do you think?
Is there anyone you trust so much that you would always obey that person?
What makes one trust someone?
