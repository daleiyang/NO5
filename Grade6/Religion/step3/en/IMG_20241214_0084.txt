Muhammad's life
Muhammad was born in 570 in the city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia.
Muhammad lost his parents early and was raised by his uncle.
In 595, Muhammad married Khadija, who was 15 years older than him.
In 610, Muhammad received God's message for the first time, which later became the Quran.
Muhammad told the inhabitants of Mecca about what he had learned, including that there is only one God.
Those who heard it did not like it, because at that time people believed in many gods.
In 622, Muhammad and his friends were forced to leave Mecca and they moved to the city of Medina.
In 630, Muhammad and his followers took Mecca after years of war, and Mecca became the center of Islam in the world.
In 632, Muhammad died.
Sunna
Sunna is an Arabic word that means habits or traditions.
Sunna deals with how people lived in Muhammad's time and especially how Muhammad used to act and live.
There are several hundred thousand stories about how Muhammad lived.
These stories inspire Muslims even today.
People read about Muhammad and try to live like him.
Next to the Quran, the texts about Sunna are the most important Muslim texts.
