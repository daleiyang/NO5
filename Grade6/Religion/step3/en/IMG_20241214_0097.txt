Hindu stories.
Important books in Hinduism.
Hinduism has many different books that tell about the religion.
Some of the holiest books are the four Vedas.
Veda means to know or knowledge.
Hindus believe that the world is created over and over again.
Hindus see the creation of the world as a cycle, something that goes round and round, without beginning and without end.
First, the god Brahma creates the world.
Then the god Vishnu takes care of the world and ensures that everything works.
After millions of years, the world is then destroyed by the god Shiva.
When the world is destroyed, Brahma creates the world once again and everything starts anew.
Humans were created by the god Brahma.
Hindus believe that it was Brahma who created the first humans.
When the world was finished, Brahma divided into two parts, a male part and a female part.
And so mankind came to be.
