The story of when Jesus rose from the dead.
2,000 years ago when Jesus lived, society was very unequal.
Men had much more power and decided on more things than women were allowed to.
Therefore, most of the stories in the Bible are about men.
But there are still some stories where women have an important role.
The story of how Jesus rose from the dead is one such story.
Jesus was buried in a cave
When Jesus had died on the cross, his body was taken down.
The disciples took care of the body and placed it in a cave.
At that time, it was common to bury important people in caves.
A large and heavy stone was rolled in front of the entrance to the cave.
Jesus rose on the third day
Three days after Jesus' death, some women went to visit the grave.
One of the women was named Mary from Magdala.
When the women arrived, the stone in front of the cave was moved, and the cave was empty.
The women were very surprised.
Who could have moved the stone that was so big and heavy?
And where had Jesus' body gone?
The women looked around and saw two angels.
The women were frightened, but the angels told them not to be afraid.
They were there to tell that Jesus had risen from the dead.
When the women looked into the cave, it was empty.
Where had Jesus' body gone?
