Buddhism.
Buddhism began with a person named Siddhartha Gautama.
Siddhartha was a prince in India more than 2,500 years ago.
Siddhartha thought a lot about how humans should act to become happy.
After several years of thinking, he finally figured out what to do.
We humans can be happy if we stop wanting so much all the time.
Because when we always want things we can't have, we become unhappy.
It's better to be satisfied with what you have.
When Siddhartha realized this, he became the Buddha.
It means that he became enlightened.
An enlightened person is someone who has discovered new knowledge about something.
After this event, Siddhartha received the name Buddha.
Those who believed in Buddha were called Buddhists, and the religion was called Buddhism.
Buddhism is a religion that exists in Thailand, China, Japan, and many other countries in Asia.
A temple is called the place where Buddhists can pray or sacrifice to Buddha.
This temple is located in Thailand.
Above the stairs, there is a huge statue of Buddha.
