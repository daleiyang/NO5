Islam is the world's second-largest religion.
Those who belong to Islam are called Muslims.
Nearly 1,500 years ago, a man named Muhammad heard an angel speak to him.
The angel's name was Gabriel.
Angel Gabriel wanted to read a text for Muhammad, and that text came directly from God.
Muhammad listened, and what he heard was written down and eventually became a whole book.
The book was named the Quran.
According to Islam, the Quran contains God's message to us humans.
The most important message in the Quran is that there is only one God.
God is called Allah in Arabic.
Muhammad was a prophet.
This means that God gave him the task of telling people what God wants.
