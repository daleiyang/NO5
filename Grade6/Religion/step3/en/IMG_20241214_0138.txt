Islam
The crescent moon and star are symbols of Islam.
They originally had no religious significance but have come to symbolize Islam.
The crescent moon and star can be found on, for example, the flags of Turkey, Pakistan, and Algeria.
This symbol is called the Hand of Fatima.
Many Muslims believe that it protects against evil things.
Fatima was the Prophet Muhammad's daughter.
The five fingers symbolize the five important pillars of Islam.
Hinduism
This symbol is called the swastika.
In Hinduism, it is a symbol for something positive.
It stands, among other things, for luck.
Many think of the swastika and Hitler when they see this symbol, but it existed long before Hitler and the Nazis began using it.
This symbol is called Aum.
It is pronounced, among other things, in prayers.
It is one of the most important Hindu symbols and gives great power when pronounced.
Buddhism
This wheel symbolizes the Eightfold Path, which is very important in Buddhism.
There are eight points that one should follow as a faithful Buddhist.
The wheel has eight spokes to show this.
All points are equally important, and one cannot ignore any of them.
Just as a wheel breaks if one removes a spoke, one fails in Buddhism if one omits a point in the Eightfold Path.
The fig tree is a common Buddhist symbol.
This is because Siddhartha sat under such a tree when he became Buddha - the enlightened one.
