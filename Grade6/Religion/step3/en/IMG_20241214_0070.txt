The prayer is led by an imam.
He stands then in this niche, the recess, in the wall.
The most important prayer of the week is the Friday prayer at noon.
The imam stands on the steps when he speaks.
This is to be seen and heard extra well.
There are no images on the walls, as it is forbidden in Islam.
But there are beautiful patterns that are sometimes texts from the Quran.
The Quran is written in a language called Arabic.
