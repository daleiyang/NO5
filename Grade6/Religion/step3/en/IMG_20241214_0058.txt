Wedding.
When a Jewish couple is getting married, they stand under a square piece of cloth.
The edges represent the four cardinal directions â€“ north, south, east, and west.
It is a way to show how important a wedding is.
In order for the wedding to take place, at least ten men over the age of 13 must be present.
The ceremony is led by a rabbi or a cantor.
The woman is not allowed to wear any jewelry at the wedding.
This is to show that all people are equally valuable before God, and one should not boast of wealth.
But the bride receives a ring from the man which he places on her right index finger.
The ceremony ends with the man breaking a wine glass with his right foot, to remind that life is not always easy and that happiness can easily be shattered.
Then the man moves the ring to the bride's left ring finger.
Here, the man breaks a glass with his foot.
It is to remind that happiness can easily be shattered.
The good thing about stones is that they do not wither.
Funeral.
When someone dies, the funeral should take place as soon as possible.
At the funeral, the rabbi or cantor talks about all the beautiful things that happened in the person's life.
The body is placed in a simple wooden coffin.
At the grave and on the coffin, mourners place flowers and stones.
The next time they visit the grave, they place new flowers and stones.
They do this to show that the person buried there is not forgotten.

The rabbi is the leader in the synagogue.
The cantor reads the texts and leads the service.
