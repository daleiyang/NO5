Freja was the fertility goddess.  
She was very beautiful.  
The giants often tried to kidnap her.  
People prayed to Freja when they wanted children.  
Loke was actually related to the giants but still belonged to the Norse gods.  
He was a cunning god who often caused problems for the other gods.  
But Loke also helped many times.  
Idun was the goddess of youth.  
She had apples that kept the Norse gods young.  
The goddess Hel was Loke's daughter.  
She ruled in the underworld.  
There people came after death.  
The words helvete and the English word hell come from the goddess Hel.
