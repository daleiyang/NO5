Jesus was sentenced to death.
Jesus was sentenced to death and died on a cross.
At this time, it was a common way to kill, to execute, those who broke the law.
Those to be executed were nailed to a cross and had to hang there until they died.
But according to the Bible, a strange thing happened.
Three days after Jesus had died and was buried, he rose from the dead and became alive again.
He appeared to the twelve disciples and many other people.
After 40 days, he returned to heaven.
In the Christian faith, one can receive forgiveness.
According to Jesus, all people sometimes sin.
For example, when one only thinks of oneself and ignores others, one sins.
It can cause a guilty conscience, and then one wants forgiveness.
Perhaps you can recognize yourself?
If you have been stupid to someone, you would like that person to say:
It's okay, I forgive you.
According to Christian faith, God forgives people through Jesus.
Therefore, Christians pray to Jesus and say:
Forgive all the stupid things I have done.
Since Jesus lived on earth, he knows what it's like to be human and can forgive.
Jesus was sentenced to death and nailed to a cross.
Sinning is doing something not allowed.
To rise means to wake from death and start living again.
What do you think?
If one has done something stupid, one would gladly be forgiven.
Why is that?
