HOROSCOPE
Some Hindus believe that the position of the stars and planets in the sky at birth affects who you are and what your future will be.
The planets and stars are constantly moving, so the sky looks different in December than in May.
To find out how the stars and planets were positioned at the exact moment of birth and what it might mean, a horoscope is made.
In India, this is done by special priests.
Important ceremonies
THE CHILD GETS ITS NAME
When a child is a few days old, it gets its name.
To find a good name, the parents use horoscopes.
With the help of horoscopes, many believe it's possible to know who you are and what the future holds.
In India, horoscopes play a big role both when naming a child and when choosing a marriage partner.
Within a month, a ceremony is held in the temple where the priest confirms the name the child has received.
The priest first holds water over the child and says prayers.
Then the parents dress the child and give it some milk to drink.
Then a fire is lit, and the parents offer flowers or fruit to a god.
In connection with this ceremony, the child receives another name, a religious name.
Before the child is a month old, a ceremony is held in the temple.
The priest then confirms the name the child has received and lights a fire.
Later, a ceremony is held when the child gets its first haircut.
Ceremony is a solemn occasion where texts are read and perhaps songs are sung.
