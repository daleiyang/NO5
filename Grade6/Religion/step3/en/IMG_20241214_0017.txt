The father explains himself to the eldest son.
When the father heard that his eldest son was angry, he left the party to talk to him.
The son told the father that he thought it was very unfair that the father had organized a big party for his brother.
The brother had wasted all the money he had received from his father.
That was nothing to reward.
But he, the eldest son, had stayed home and taken care of the father.
Why had the father never organized a party for him?
The father then told his eldest son that he had always appreciated having him at home.
But at the same time, it was true that the youngest son had been lost.
No one knew where he was or if he would come home.
And now that he had finally come home, it was really a good opportunity to have a party.
Jesus wanted to talk about forgiveness.
The story of the lost son is about forgiveness and that one can always come back.
According to Christian belief, people should forgive each other.
But even God can forgive people if they have done something foolish.
The youngest son in the story regretted and received his father's forgiveness.
In the same way, people can receive God's forgiveness if they repent.
One can think of the father in the story as God and the youngest son as a person who has done something foolish.
What would you do?
Imagine that you are the father.
How would you have received the son who came home?
Would you have done something different from the father in the story?
