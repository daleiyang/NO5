Visiting a Buddhist home.
We are invited to a Buddhist family from Tibet.
When we enter the door, we immediately feel a special scent.
It is incense that smells.
We look around and see that incense is burning at an altar.
On the altar stands a small figure of Buddha.
It is common to light incense as an offering to Buddha.
It is also common to offer flowers.
Most Buddhists have pictures or figures representing Buddha in their homes.
THE PRAYER WHEEL HELPS THE BUDDHIST PRAY MORE PRAYERS.
The father in the family shows us a prayer wheel.
Inside the mill are paper rolls with prayers.
When you turn the mill, you imagine these prayers are released.
You can thus read many more prayers by turning the mill than if you would read them in the usual way.
Not all Buddhists use prayer wheels, but those living in Tibet do.
Incense is wooden sticks that look like sparklers.
On the sticks there is a plant mixture that burns slowly.
Many think the smoke formed smells good.
An altar is a place that is slightly elevated where people pray and offer.
In a temple, the altar is often large, but at home, the altar can be a regular table.
