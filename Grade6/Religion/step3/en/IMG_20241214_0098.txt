Brahma was born from a Lotus flower.
There are many stories that describe how the creation of the world and the gods took place.
One of them tells that the god Brahma was born from a lotus flower that came out of the navel of the god Vishnu.
Brahma wanted humans to have a temple where they could worship him.
Therefore, he took the lotus flower he was born from and let it fall to the earth.
The flower landed in a place in India and there a lake was formed.
Then a city and a temple were built by the lake where Brahma was worshipped.
The city was named Pushkar which means "born from a flower."
The temple still exists today and is one of the few temples in the world where the god Brahma is still worshipped.
The lotus flower is a symbol of luck and fertility.
Many Hindus travel to Pushkar to visit Brahma's temple and the holy lake.
This man is praying for his father who has passed away.
A symbol is a sign that means something special.
Fertility is something that grows well.
It can also mean that it is easy to have children.
Worship means looking up to someone very much.
If you worship a god, you pray to that god often.
