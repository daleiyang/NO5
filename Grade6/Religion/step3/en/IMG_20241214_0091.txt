Golden rule
Jesus said that "all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them."
It means that you should treat others the way you want others to treat you.
The rule is commonly known as the golden rule and it exists in many religions.
Some believe that no other rules are needed.
What do you think?
Is there ever a time when the golden rule doesn't work?
Why don't all people live by it?
Give to the poor
In Islam, it is very important to care for the poor in society.
One of Islam's five pillars, therefore one of the five most important points, states that one should give part of what one earns to the poor.
What do you think?
Is it fair that those who have earned a lot of money should give to the poor?
