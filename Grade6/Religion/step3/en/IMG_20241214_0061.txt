The ten commandments.
This is a painting depicting Moses when he received the commandments from God.
The commandments are important for both Jews and Christians.
1. You shall have no other gods before me.
It means that there is only one god and nothing should be more important than God.
2. You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God.
It means that names are important.
The name is connected to the person.
If one jokes or makes fun of a name, one also mocks the person who has the name.
3. Remember to keep the Sabbath day holy.
This means that the Sabbath is important and special.
The Sabbath is the same as a day of rest.
In Sweden, Sundays are a rest day, a day when you, for example, don't have to go to school.
In Judaism, Saturday is the day of rest.
On that day, it is meant for people and animals to rest.
