Different Buddhist groups.
There are about 500 million Buddhists in the world.
Most live in China, Japan, Thailand, Cambodia, and Tibet.
Buddhism differs greatly from country to country.
A Buddhist in Sweden does not live in the same way as a Buddhist in Asia does.
There are big differences, and this is because Buddhism has always adapted to the country to which it has spread.
A temple does not need to be a large building.
It can also be a room decorated with flowers and a statue of Buddha.
This temple is located in Stockholm.
On the floor, you see mats and cushions on which people sit when making offerings and praying.
