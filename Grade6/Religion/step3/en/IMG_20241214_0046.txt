The story of the first humans.
The first humans on earth were named Adam and Eve.
Adam means "man" and Eve means "to give life".
They lived in a garden called Eden.
It was the most beautiful place one could imagine and they had it very good.
God told Adam and Eve that they could eat from all the fruits in the garden, except the fruit from the tree called the Tree of Knowledge.
That fruit was forbidden for them.
One day when Eve was walking around the garden she met a snake.
The snake was the cleverest of all the animals.
It told Eve that if you eat the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge, you will become very wise.
Then Eve ate the fruit and also gave some to Adam.
When they had eaten the fruit, they became wiser, but they also saw things they hadn't seen before.
They suddenly saw that they were naked.
They hadn't thought about that before.
Adam and Eve then took leaves from a fig tree and tied them around their waists to avoid being naked.
God punished the humans.
When God noticed that Adam and Eve had eaten the forbidden fruit, he became very angry.
As punishment, he forced them to leave Eden.
Now they had to manage on their own.
Adam's punishment was also that he would have to work hard to provide food for himself and his family.
Eve's punishment was that it would be very painful to give birth to children.
The snake's punishment was that it would always crawl on the ground and that humans would hate snakes forever.
WHAT do you think?
Adam and Eve were not supposed to eat the forbidden fruit but did it anyway.
Have you ever done something forbidden yourself?
Why do people do things they shouldn't?
