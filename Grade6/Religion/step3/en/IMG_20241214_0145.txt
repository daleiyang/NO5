THE AESIR GODS
Thor
Thor was a strong god.
His main weapon was a hammer called Mjölner.
When Thor threw the Mjölner, it always returned to his hand again.
Thor used Mjölner when he fought his enemy giants.
When it thundered and lightning in the human world, they believed it was Thor who was out driving his wagon.
It was said that when he drove his wagon across the sky, it rumbled, and when he threw his hammer, it flashed.
Therefore, people called Thor the thunder god.
Odin
Odin was the highest god.
He ruled over all the other gods.
Odin was very wise and had knowledge about everything.
It was said that he once sacrificed one of his eyes to gain all the wisdom in the world.
Odin had two ravens named Hugin and Munin.
They flew out every morning to find out what was happening in the world and then returned to Odin to tell him the news.
