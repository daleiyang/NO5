The Sacrifice Feast (Id al-Adha)
When? The pilgrimage is a period of the year when many Muslims travel to Mecca.
On the last day of the pilgrimage, the Sacrifice Feast is celebrated.
Those who have not traveled to Mecca celebrate at home.
The celebration lasts for four days.
Why? To remember that Abraham was prepared to sacrifice his son to obey God.
God stopped Abraham just before he was about to kill his son, and he sacrificed an animal instead.
How? In the morning, people take a bath and prepare to go to the mosque.
In the mosque, everyone prays together.
During the Id festivals, people eat good food.
There are many different dishes and not all Muslims eat the same food.
Often, people eat a lot of sweets and dried fruit.
It is common to sacrifice an animal just as Abraham did.
The most common is to sacrifice a sheep.
The meat is then used for food and in many countries, it is given to the poor.
In Sweden, it is forbidden to slaughter animals without a special permit.
Therefore, many Muslims in Sweden instead give money to a Muslim country.
In the afternoon, people meet family and friends and eat festive food together.
It is also common for children to receive gifts.
Pilgrimage means traveling to an important place.
To sacrifice is to give something to God.
