The Buddhist faith
Buddhism is based on Buddha's thoughts and the truth he discovered when he sat under the fig tree and meditated.
Everything changes all the time
Buddha discovered that everything in life changes.
There is nothing the same throughout a lifetime.
Take the body for example, it changes all the time.
The same goes for what we like, what we want to do, and the friends we have.
Then Buddha thought that because everything changes it is foolish to cling to something and believe it will last.
Surely you should have a friend, but don't think that friendship will last a lifetime.
Because if you believe that everything in life will always be the same, you will only be sad and disappointed.
"I want"
Buddha also said that one should try to get away from the feeling of always wanting more.
More money, more love, more friends, a better bike, and so on.
Those who manage that will find peace and calm in life and reach what is called nirvana.
Nirvana
When a Buddhist has learned to no longer desire a bunch of things, he or she reaches nirvana.
For some Buddhists, nirvana is like a heaven to reach, but for most it is more a way to feel and experience, a state.
The road to nirvana is difficult and long.
A person must meditate, learn to live correctly, and above all try to understand Buddha's thoughts.
If she does that, then she will reach nirvana.
Nirvana is the goal for all Buddhists.
WHAT do you think?
Buddha believed that the person who has no desires and does not long for more becomes happy and calm.
