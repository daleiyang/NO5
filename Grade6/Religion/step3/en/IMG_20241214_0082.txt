An imam leads the wedding.
He explains that the man shall provide for the family and the woman shall take care of the home.
After that, the couple signs a marriage contract.
WEDDING
The wedding can take place at home or in the mosque under the guidance of an imam.
The imam explains what are the responsibilities of the man and what are those of the woman.
For example, a man must provide for the family and the woman should take care of the children and the home.
After the imam's speech, the couple signs a contract called a marriage contract.
Among other things, it determines how the money will be divided between the man and the woman.
After the contract is signed, the man and woman say to each other:
"I hereby declare that I am married to ... (name) before God and according to the prophet's sunnah."
The prophet is Muhammad and sunnah is the tradition that Muhammad lived by.
There should be witnesses at the wedding.
They must hear when this is said.
BURIAL
According to Islam, a burial should take place as soon as possible after someone has died, preferably within 24 hours.
The deceased is placed in a grave in the ground.
The body is placed in a piece of cloth on the right side, with the face turned toward Mecca.
Preferably, the body should be buried in a coffin.
In their will, the deceased can often decide who will lead the burial.
It can be a relative or an imam.
The one who leads the ceremony prays for the deceased, for themselves, and for all Muslims.
In Islam, it's forbidden to cremate the body.
According to tradition, the deceased is questioned by two angels about their life, and then the deceased needs their body.
The imam leads prayers and ceremonies in the mosque.
In a contract, something agreed upon has been written down.
A will is written before one dies.
Among other things, it determines who will inherit money and other things.
Cremation means burning a body so that it only becomes ash.
