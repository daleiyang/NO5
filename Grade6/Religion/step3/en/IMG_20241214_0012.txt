Baptism candles.
There are two candles in the living room.
These are the children's baptism candles.
When a child is baptized in the Swedish church, a candle is lit in the church.
The candle is lit to show that the child then goes from darkness to light, from being non-Christian to Christian.
This candle is then taken home by the child's parents as a memory of the baptism.
Many light the candle every year to remember the baptism day.
When the candle is finished, you can get a new one in the church.
