Important symbols and signs.
Within all religions, there are symbols and signs.
They are used for several reasons.
Sometimes you want to show that you belong to a specific religion.
Sometimes they are used because they bring luck, power, or protect against evil things.
JUDAISM
This star is called the Star of David.
It is an important symbol for Jews.
David was a Jewish king who lived a long time ago.
During his reign, the country prospered, and he created a great Jewish kingdom.
The Star of David is on the flag of Israel.
The six points of the star are sometimes said to symbolize that God protects Israel from all directions.
This seven-branched candelabrum is called a menorah.
It is important for Jews because there was a large seven-branched candelabrum in the old temple in Jerusalem.
The candelabrum was stolen 2,000 years ago when the temple was destroyed.
Since then, it has been an important symbol for the Jews.
CHRISTIANITY
The cross is the most common Christian symbol.
It is because Jesus died nailed to a cross.
For Christians, the cross does not mean death, which one might think since it often appears in obituaries in the newspaper.
Instead, the cross signifies victory over death.
Jesus died but then rose from the dead.
Those who believe in Jesus will also rise from the dead and gain eternal life.
The dove is a Christian symbol.
It represents the Holy Spirit who is always around us.
The dove is also a symbol for peace.
