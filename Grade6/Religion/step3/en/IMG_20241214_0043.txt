mezuzah
In a Jewish home, there should be a small mezuzah on the side of each door.
Inside it, there are short texts.
The texts are about the Jews' faith in God.
When passing the mezuzah, one should ideally touch it.
One should also think of God and remember to follow God's will.
Visiting a Jewish home
It's Friday and we are visiting a Jewish family.
As we enter the door, we see a small capsule hanging next to the door.
It is called a mezuzah.
The Sabbath is the Jewish day of rest
The family has gathered to celebrate the Sabbath together.
Sabbath is the name of the Jewish day of rest.
It begins when the sun sets on Friday evening and ends when the sun sets on Saturday evening.
Jews have a day of rest because God also had a day of rest.
When God created the earth, He did it in six days and then rested on the seventh day.
One can celebrate the Sabbath in a few different ways.
This family follows many of the existing rules and traditions.
One may not work during the Sabbath and therefore may not bake bread either.
Instead, bread is baked before the sun sets on Friday so that it lasts the entire Sabbath.
Just before it gets dark, the women and girls in the family say a prayer.
Then they light two Sabbath candles.
These candles should burn until they go out by themselves.
No one may extinguish them.
Lighting and extinguishing candles is considered work and during the Sabbath, no one should work.
A capsule is a container that protects what is inside.
Sabbath is the Jewish day of rest.
Tradition is something that has been done in the same way for a long time.
