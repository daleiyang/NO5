The world's largest statue of Jesus
The world's largest statue of Jesus is in the city of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil.
It is 38 meters high.
That's about as high as if 26 students in your class stood on top of each other.
The Tower of Babel
In the Bible, there is a story about why there are different languages in the world.
It is the story of the Tower of Babel.
According to the Bible, all people spoke the same language at first.
But then the people of Babylon decided to build a tower that reached all the way up to God in heaven.
When God saw what they did, he became angry.
The people showed too much self-confidence.
God did not want people to reach heaven.
To prevent them from succeeding, God made all people start speaking different languages.
Then they could no longer talk to each other and they could not finish building the tower.
Angels
Angels appear in several stories in the Bible.
They often come with messages from God.
For example, it was an angel who told Jesus' mother Mary that she would bear a son, the Son of God.
That angel was Gabriel.
Angels are also important in the stories of Judaism and Islam.
Angels are often depicted with two wings and shining with light.
