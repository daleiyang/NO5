Inside a mosque.
In this picture, we see several things usually found in mosques.
A Muslim should pray to God five times a day.
If possible, one goes to a mosque and prays.
It is mainly the men who do it, the women do not need to.
If one cannot go to the mosque, it is fine to pray at the place where one is at that moment.
There are no chairs in a mosque; everyone sits on the floor.
