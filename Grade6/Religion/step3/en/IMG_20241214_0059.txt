The Jewish faith.
Jews believe in one God.
God is called Yahweh in Hebrew.
Hebrew is the Jews' own language, their native language.
Jews in Sweden say God when they speak Swedish and Yahweh when they speak Hebrew.
Many Jews do not say God or Yahweh, because they have such great respect for God that they never say His name.
They instead say the Lord.
According to Jewish belief, God has created the world, humans, and animals, yes everything that exists.
God cares about people, even when they do wrong.
Sometimes He can be harsh and punishing, and sometimes kind and forgiving.
God gave Abraham a mission
According to Jewish belief, God made an agreement with Abraham when He spoke to him 4,000 years ago.
They agreed that Abraham and his family would tell others about God.
God in turn promised to be the Jews' friend.
The Jews say that God and Abraham made a covenant.
Man is like God
According to Judaism, we humans are like God and we should help Him create a fine world.
God knows that we are intelligent.
He also knows that we cannot handle everything and that we do foolish things sometimes.
But according to the Jews, God forgives us when we do wrong.
WHO IS A JEW?

One who has converted to Judaism, thus switched from another faith to Judaism.
JEWS ARE WAITING FOR THE MESSIAH
Many Jews believe that God in the future will send a good king to the earth.
They call this king the Messiah.
When the Messiah comes, there will be peace on earth and all people will be happy.
Some Jews believe that the Messiah is not a person.
Instead, they are waiting for a time when there will be peace on the whole earth and goodness will prevail.
Hebrew is the religious language of the Jews.
The Messiah is a king whom the Jews are waiting for.
When the Messiah comes, there will be peace on earth.
Another word for agreement is covenant.
