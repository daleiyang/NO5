The Muslim faith.
Muslims believe in only one God.
The greatest mistake a person can make is to believe in multiple gods or let something mean as much as God.
In Arabic, God is called Allah.
A Muslim who speaks Swedish says God.
Those who speak Arabic say Allah.
Muhammad is God's prophet.
According to Islam, Muhammad is God's prophet.
That means God sent a message with Muhammad for him to pass on.
That message was the Quran.
In the Quran, God explains how people should live and how we should treat each other.
There it also says how people should believe in God.
Muhammad received the Quran from God and passed it on to people on earth.
Therefore, he is the most important person in Islam.
Within Islam, it is forbidden to paint images of people.
Instead, it is common to write in such a beautiful way that the text becomes like a fine picture.
Such writing is called calligraphy.
In this image, it says Muhammad.
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have much in common.
They come from the same part of the world.
They believe in the same God.
They have a common background (for example, Abraham).
They believe that God created the world, humans, and animals.
What do you think?
Jews, Christians, and Muslims have fought a lot throughout history.
Why do you think they have done this, given they have so much in common?
