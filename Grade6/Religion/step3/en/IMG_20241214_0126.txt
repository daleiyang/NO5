THE FLOATING BOWLS FESTIVAL (LOI KRATHONG)
In Thailand, almost all people are Buddhists.
The most famous Thai festival is called the festival of floating bowls.
In Thai, the language spoken in Thailand, the festival is called Loi Krathong.
Loi means approximately to float.
A Krathong is a small bowl that is usually made of, among other things, banana leaves.
When?
This festival is celebrated in November, on the evening when there is a full moon.
How?
You build small boats out of banana leaves.
These boats resemble lotus flowers.
In the boats, you place candles and incense.
Sometimes you also put in some money.
When evening has come and the moon is up, you go to the nearest lake or river.
There, you place the small boat in the water and let it float away.
Many children swim after the boats and collect the ones with money in them.
During the festival of floating bowls, it is common also to read the story of Prince Vessantara.
Reading this story is said to be a very good deed.
Why?
Many believe that there are spirits in the water.
These spirits like the beautiful boats and they therefore help the person who has sent the boat to get more luck.
One could say that the boats carry away all the misfortune that surrounds us.
It is very beautiful to see all the small boats on the river with their burning candles.
Those who send off the boats hope to get luck in life.
SPIRITS IN BUDDHISM
In Thailand, people used to believe that there were spirits.
When Buddhism came to the country, many people retained this belief.
For the Buddhists who came to Thailand, this did nothing.
The important thing was that people believed in what Buddha talked about.
If people then wanted to ask the spirits for better luck, it did nothing.
Incense are wooden sticks that look like sparklers.
On the sticks, there is a plant mixture that burns slowly.
Many think that the smoke produced smells good.
Spirits are beings that one cannot see but that some people believe live around us.
