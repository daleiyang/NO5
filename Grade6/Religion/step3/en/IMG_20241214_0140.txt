ISLAM
In Islam, a person will either go to God in paradise or to hell when they die.
It is those who believe in God who go to paradise, and those who do not believe who end up in hell.
Paradise is a wonderful place that has everything we lack on earth, and hell is a terrible place.
Both heaven and hell are clearly described in the Quran.
In paradise, one can lie on soft cushions and be well.
In hell, people have to do terrible things like drink boiling hot water and "the disgusting fluid that oozes from wounds".
For many Muslims, these are images of how it feels to be with or without God.
Hinduism
Within Hinduism, there are several different answers and thoughts about what happens after death.
One idea is that a person is reincarnated into a new life on earth.
A second idea is that there are heavens and other places that one can end up in for a while before returning to earth again.
A third idea is that a person meets the god they worshiped during their life and gets to live with that god.
A fourth idea is that a person is not reincarnated to earth but becomes part of the divine force Brahman.
BUDDHISM
Buddhists believe that two things can happen to a person when they die.
The most common is that a person is reborn again and again into new lives on earth.
But sometimes, when a person has understood everything Buddha taught, they will not be reborn on earth.
Then the person becomes enlightened and reaches Nirvana.
Nirvana is the name for what is sometimes described as a heaven, but more often as something indescribable.
It is just something one ends up in.
What do you believe?
One can think a lot about what happens to us when we die.
Do we stay in another world, disappear, or are we born again?
