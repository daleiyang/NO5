Purim is a Jewish festival of joy.
Then people celebrate the victory of good over evil.
During this holiday, it is common for children to dress up and perform plays.
This boy has dressed up as a ghost.
In other religions, there are also holidays where people dress up.
In Christianity, for example, people dress up when celebrating Lucia.
Lucia is a Christian saint.
Jewish Calendar
To know when things have happened, we count the years that pass.
In Sweden, we follow the Christian calendar, which starts from the year Jesus was born.
When we say the year 2000, it means it was 2,000 years since Jesus was born.
This calendar is used in large parts of the world.
But there is also a Jewish calendar.
It starts from the year believed to be when God created the world.
The year we called 2000 was called 5760 in the Jewish calendar.
– Oh, so the year we called 2000 was something else for Jews?
– Yes, it was called the year 5760.
The Commandments were stored in a chest
Moses received the Ten Commandments from God.
According to stories in the Bible, the commandments were on two stone tablets.
These tablets were placed in a wooden chest with gold.
The chest was brought to the great temple in Jerusalem.
When the temple was destroyed two thousand years ago, the chest disappeared and no one knows where it went.
The chest is called the Ark of the Covenant.
