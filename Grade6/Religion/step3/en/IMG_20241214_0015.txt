Christianity
The story of the prodigal son.
Being able to forgive is very important in Christianity.
To explain this to people, Jesus told this story.
A rich man had two sons.
One day, the younger son said:
â€“ Father, when you die, I will inherit money and a lot of things from you.
Can't I have them already now?
The father did as his son wanted and gave him the part of the inheritance that would be his.
The son immediately sold all the things and after a few days went on a long journey to a foreign country.
The son squanders his money
In the new country, the son squandered his money, and soon all the money was gone.
He was forced to look for a job to make ends meet.
He got a job as a pig keeper with a farmer.
There he saw how the pigs got lots of food.
He could hardly eat enough himself as he got very little pay.
He now regretted that he had left his father and his brother.
The son returns
After a while, the younger son went home again.
He told his father that he was sorry he had left and that he had squandered all the money.
He was ashamed, and regretted it very much.
But the father was not angry.
He said, on the contrary, that he was very happy and wanted them to celebrate that the son had come back.
The father had the fattest calf slaughtered and had a real feast.
Then he gave the younger son party clothes to wear and a precious ring.
The party started.
Inheritance is something you get from a person who has died.
Children always inherit their parents.
An inheritance can be money or things.
