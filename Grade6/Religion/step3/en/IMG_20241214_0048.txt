The brothers decided to kill Joseph.
Joseph's brothers were shepherds and one day Joseph greeted the brothers when they were tending their sheep.
When the brothers saw Joseph coming, they decided to kill him.
First they took off his fine clothes and then threw him into a well.
They planned to leave him there to die.
The brothers sold Joseph as a slave.
But after a little while, a group of merchants rode by on their camels.
They were on their way to Egypt.
Joseph's brothers realized they could sell Joseph as a slave to the merchants instead of leaving him in the well.
Then they could make money while getting rid of their brother.
Together they pulled Joseph out of the well.
The merchants bought Joseph and took him to Egypt.
To make Jacob believe that Joseph had been killed by wild animals, the brothers dipped Joseph's clothes in animal blood and gave them to him.
Jacob was very sad to have lost his favorite son.
Joseph ended up in prison.
In Egypt, Joseph ended up in prison.
There he met two prisoners who had previously worked for the pharaoh, the king in Egypt.
One morning, the men told Joseph that they had dreamed something strange during the night.
Joseph was good at interpreting dreams and he helped the men understand what the dreams meant.
One man would soon die.
The other man would soon be released and get his job back with the pharaoh.
A few days later, it happened just as Joseph had said.
