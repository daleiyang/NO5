Joseph's family came to Egypt.
After seven years, there was a shortage of food in Canaan and the other countries around Egypt.
Jacob and his family still lived in Canaan.
They heard that there was plenty of food in Egypt.
Therefore, Jacob sent his sons, Joseph's brothers, to Egypt to buy food.
When Joseph's brothers came to Egypt, they met Joseph.
They didn't recognize him, but Joseph recognized his brothers.
When he told them who he was, the brothers were initially afraid.
They thought he would take revenge.
But Joseph was not angry.
Instead, he wanted the whole family to move to Egypt so he could help them.
In Egypt, he was a powerful man, and there was plenty of food.
Everyone thought this was a good idea.
Jacob and his entire family therefore moved to Joseph in Egypt, and there they had a very good life together.
What do you think?
Joseph forgave his brothers even though they had been really foolish towards him.
Can one forgive everything or are there things that are unforgivable?
