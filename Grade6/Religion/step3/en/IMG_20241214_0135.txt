Nonviolence
In Hinduism, nonviolence is important.
One should preferably not use violence against anyone, neither people nor animals.
One of India's greatest leaders was called Mahatma Gandhi.
When he lived, India was not independent.
This means that the Indians did not govern their own country.
It was Great Britain that governed India.
Mahatma Gandhi wanted India to become independent.
But instead of fighting the British with violence, Gandhi and the Indians used nonviolence.
They had peaceful demonstrations and the like.
This method succeeded, and India eventually became independent.

Do you think there are times when one must use violence, or is the peaceful way always the best?
