EASTER
When? In the spring, in March or April.
Why? Easter is celebrated because Jesus rose from the dead, after being crucified.
How? Easter is the most important Christian holiday and it lasts several days.
The first important day is Good Friday, the day Jesus was crucified.
On this day, Christians take it easy.
Many go to church.
Sometimes the church organizes a Good Friday walk.
The Christians walk together to remember how Jesus walked before he was crucified.
From time to time, they stop to read a story about Jesus or sing a hymn.
On Easter Eve, families often gather and eat a good meal together.
Easter Sunday is the most important day of Easter.
It was on Easter Sunday that Jesus rose from the dead, and this is naturally a day of joy.
Easter Eggs
During Easter, people eat a lot of eggs.
It is a tradition that goes back several hundred years.
Back then, Christians fasted for 40 days before Easter.
This meant they could not eat meat and eggs.
All the eggs laid by the hens were saved, so at Easter there were very many eggs that had to be eaten.
Today it is common to paint the eggs in nice colors.
A psalm is a religious song.
