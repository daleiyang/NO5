Jewish holidays.
Judaism has many holidays.
The holidays described here are among the most important and are celebrated by most Jews.
New Year (Rosh Hashanah).
When? In the fall, in September or October.
Why? To remember that God created the world and that each year is a new start when people can do things a little better than the year before.
How? The New Year celebration lasts ten days.
Every weekday a ram's horn is blown outside the synagogue.
When a Jew hears the sound of the horn, they should think about what they did wrong during the year and repent.
One asks both God and people for forgiveness.
But it is also important to forgive others.
When the new year begins, one hopefully has no enemies.
During this holiday, it is also important to consider how one can become a better person.
On the first evening of the New Year celebration, the family usually gathers to eat a good dinner.
They also eat sweet things, like pomegranates and bread dipped in honey.
This is done in the hope of a sweet and good new year.
Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).
The last day of the New Year celebration is called the Day of Atonement.
On this day, people should reconcile with God.
This means wanting God's forgiveness for all the things promised but not done.
But one cannot receive forgiveness from God if one has not first reconciled with those they have been at odds with.
The Day of Atonement is very important for Jews.
Many Jews fast all day.
A ram's horn is the horn of a ram.
It is used as a wind instrument in Judaism.
A pomegranate is a sweet fruit resembling an apple on the outside.
The inside is full of small seeds that can be eaten.
Reconcile means to forgive and become friends again.
Fasting means not eating or drinking.
