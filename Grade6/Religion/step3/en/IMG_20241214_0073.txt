Muslim stories
The Quran is the Muslims' most important book
The holy book of the Muslims is called the Quran.
There you can read about the Muslim faith and the rules that Muslims should follow.
According to Islam, the text in the Quran is an exact copy of God's words that are written down in heaven.
The Quran is written in Arabic because it is the language it is written in heaven.
It cannot be translated because then it would no longer be God's exact words.
Quran means approximately "recitation".
It is called that because an angel recited from the heavenly Quran to the Prophet Muhammad.
Muhammad then ensured that the stories were written down.
Since the Quran is written in Arabic, it has become the language of Islam, even in countries where Arabic is not spoken.
The Muslim creation story
This is how the Quran describes how God created the world and humans.
First, God created the darkness of night and the light of day.
After that, he spread out the surface of the earth.
He then let water flow and the meadows and fields bloom.
God also created the mountains.
Everything he created was to make it good for humans on earth.
When the earth was finished, God created humans.
From clay, God made a drop that grew and became a large lump.
God then created bones on this lump and clothed it with flesh.
Thus, humans came to be.
Many Muslims have a small Quran in a pocket close to the heart.
In this way, they are always close to God.
The Quran is the most important religious book for Muslims.
There you can read about the Muslim faith and the rules that Muslims should follow.
It is a copy of the book that exists with God.
Sinning is doing something that is not allowed.
