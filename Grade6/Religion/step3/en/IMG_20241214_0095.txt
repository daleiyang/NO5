Visiting a Hindu home
We are visiting a Hindu family.
The first thing we notice is that the family has a small temple in their home.
There are pictures of the different gods that the family worships.
Hindus believe in many different gods.
But most Hindus have a god they like especially much.
Sometimes Hindus go to a large temple and pray to that god.
But most often they pray to the god at home.
While they pray, they also usually offer something, such as food or flowers.
This is called puja.
The family's temple contains flowers and pictures of gods.
The large picture on the right depicts Shiva.
He is the family's favorite god.
