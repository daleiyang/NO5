Here you can read some examples of what Jesus said.
“If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.”
Turning the other cheek means not to retaliate.
If someone does something stupid to you, you should not do the same back.
“Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.”
Jesus said you should love everyone, even your enemies.
You shall pray for them and hope that things go well for them.
Many find this a difficult rule.
It’s not always easy to wish good things for people you don’t like.
“Do to others what you want them to do for you.”
This is usually called the golden rule.
Many believe you don’t need any other rules as long as you follow it.
What would you do?
One of your classmates is named Kim.
You don’t like Kim.
That's because Kim is often mean to you.
Once Kim told you that you had an ugly sweater, so everyone heard it.
Another time at gym class, Kim intentionally pushed you so you scraped one knee and had to see the school nurse.
So you have a reason not to like Kim.
Sometimes you even come up with plans on how you can get revenge.
Imagine now that you will follow what Jesus said.
What would you do next time Kim does something stupid to you?
