What happens after death?
At all times, people have pondered what happens after death.
Each religion has its own answer to that question.
CHRISTIANITY
Christians believe that all people who believe in God go to heaven.
There they get to meet God and live happily.
Those who do not believe in God go to a place without God and it is called hell.
In the past, priests in the church scared people with hell and how terrible it would be to end up there.
But that is not so common today.
JUDAISM
According to Judaism, it is uncertain what happens after death and most Jews say they do not know.
In the Jewish Bible, a shadowy realm is mentioned, where all people end up.
It is a realm that does not resemble Earth and cannot be understood.
A person might also end up in hell, but no longer than 12 months.
After that, the person moves on to the shadowy realm or perhaps lives on in the memory of the living.
