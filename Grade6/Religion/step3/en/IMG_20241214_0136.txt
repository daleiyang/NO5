karma
Within both Hinduism and Buddhism, karma is an important concept.
Karma means actions.
It is believed that everything a person does affects one.
If you do something good, it will lead to something good and you will be happy.
If you do something bad, it will punish itself.

The Middle Path
In Buddhism, it is said that the best path is the middle way.
A person should not live in luxury and abundance, but neither in poverty.
What do you think?
Isn't the best life one of wealth and luxury?
Is there anything negative about living a life of abundance?
A white lie?
In Buddhism, there are some basic rules to follow for a good life.
One of these rules is that you should not lie.
It is a rule found in most religions.
Most people also agree that you should not lie.
But sometimes it might be better to lie than to tell the truth.
Such a lie is usually called a white lie.
What do you think?
Is it always wrong to lie?
Are there occasions when it is better to lie than to tell the truth?
If so, why?
Can you give some examples?
