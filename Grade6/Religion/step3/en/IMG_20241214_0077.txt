We take a closer look at.
Three important cities in Islam.
MUHAMMED’S NIGHT JOURNEY.
In Islam, there is a story about how Muhammed one night traveled to Jerusalem.
He rode on an animal called Buraq.
In the time when Muhammed lived, it took several weeks to travel to Jerusalem.
But Muhammed traveled there with God’s help and therefore could go back and forth in one night.
When Muhammad was in Jerusalem, he met several other prophets.
Two of them were Abraham and Moses.
They had died a long time ago and were now in heaven with God.
But that night they appeared to Muhammed and together they prayed to God.
It was Muhammed who led the prayer.
According to Muslims, it is a sign that he is the most important of all prophets that have ever existed.
Buraq is often depicted as a horse with a woman's head and a peacock’s tail.
The Dome of the Rock.
In Jerusalem, there is the Dome of the Rock.
It sits on a rock in the middle of Jerusalem.
Muslims believe that it was on that rock that Muhammed prayed with the other prophets.
