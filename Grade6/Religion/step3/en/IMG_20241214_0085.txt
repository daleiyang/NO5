Humans are good.
According to Islam, humans are good from birth and resemble God.
God is reasonable and therefore humans are also reasonable.
But humans sometimes do foolish things and need help.
Therefore, humans have received five points from God which they should follow.
These five points are called the five pillars and form the foundation for how every Muslim should live.
The five pillars that everyone must follow.
1. The first pillar is the profession of faith and it should be recited every day.
"There is no god but God and Muhammad is his prophet."
2. The second pillar is prayer.
At five times a day, a Muslim should pray to God.
It can occur anywhere, at home, on the street, at work, or in the mosque.
Ideally, one should pray with others.
3. The third pillar is the alms.
Alms, or zakat as it is called in Arabic, are money given to the poor and for charitable purposes.
A Muslim should give away 2.5% of saved money each year.
In the mosque, women and men pray separately.
In this mosque in Malm√∂, the women sit in a balcony.
The men pray below on the floor.
When Muslims pray, they face Mecca.
Charitable purposes are, for example, when one gives money to a charity that helps the poor in the world.
The money can help build a school in a poor area or a hospital.
