The eldest son thinks the father is unfair.
The eldest son had stayed on the farm and continued to work for the father.
When he came home from work that day, he heard music and dancing and wondered what was going on.
He then found out that his brother had come home and that the father had therefore arranged a big party.
The eldest son then became very angry and absolutely did not want to be at the party.
