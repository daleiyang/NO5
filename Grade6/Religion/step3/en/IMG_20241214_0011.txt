Visiting a Christian home
We are invited to a Christian family for dinner.
It is a regular weekday evening, so we are not celebrating any special holiday.
In this family, they say grace before beginning to eat to thank God for the food.
Some Christians do this.
You can also pray for yourself or in church.
Praying is a way to talk to God.
You can thank God for good things that have happened and ask God for help to overcome difficult things.
You can pray however you want, but it is sometimes comforting to use a pre-written prayer.
Then you can look in a prayer book.
There are many written prayers there.
OUR FATHER
The most important Christian prayer is called Our Father.
When Jesus told the people how they should pray, it was this prayer that he wanted them to use.
Most Christians know Our Father by heart.
Our Father, who is in heaven.
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever.
Amen
A prayer is a way to talk to God.
Often Christians clasp their hands when they pray.
Hallowed means that something is honored, in this case that God's name should be used in a good way.
