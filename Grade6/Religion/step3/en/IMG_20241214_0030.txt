Jesus appeared to the women.
Mary from Magdala was the first to see Jesus when he appeared.
Jesus told Mary and the others to go to his disciples and tell them that he had risen.
But when the women told the disciples, the disciples did not believe them.
It was only later, when the disciples themselves saw Jesus, that they believed he had risen.
Jesus then told the disciples they were wrong not to believe what Mary from Magdala and the other women had said.
What can one learn from the story?
Many think that this story shows that women have a role just as important as men.
Jesus chose to appear to some women although it was the men who held power at this time.
And when the disciples did not believe what the women had seen, Jesus told them it was wrong.
One should believe in women as much as in men.
When the women said that Jesus had risen, the disciples did not believe them.
Did you know that...
Mary from Magdala is also called Mary Magdalene.
What do you think?
When Jesus lived, boys had more rights than girls.
In today's society, everyone should have the same rights and be treated equally.
Still, girls and boys are sometimes treated differently.
Have you ever experienced that?
What can be done to change that?
