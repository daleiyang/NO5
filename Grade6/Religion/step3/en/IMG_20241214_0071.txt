Visiting a Muslim home.
We are invited to a Muslim family celebrating Ramadan.
Ramadan is the Muslim fasting month and during that month all Muslims fast.
It means they do not eat or drink anything as long as the sun is up.
The youngest children in the family do not need to fast.
The reason Muslims fast is to empathize with the poor in the world.
They also want to focus their attention more on God.
During Ramadan, family and friends meet in the evening to eat and have a good time together.
The fast is broken when the sun goes down.
The sun has just set and the family is preparing to break the fast.
The first thing they eat is some dates.
They also drink a few sips of water.
It is very common for Muslims to eat dates during Ramadan.
This is because the Prophet Muhammad often ate dates after fasting, and many Muslims like to do as he did.
Muhammad is the most important prophet in Islam and is therefore an important role model.
Dates are fruits that grow on date palms.
They are dark and taste sweet.
MUSLIM FOOD
The word halal means "permitted" in Arabic.
The word is used by Muslims for food that is allowed to eat.
For example, one may eat vegetables, poultry, lamb, certain types of fish, and beef.
All meat must be slaughtered by an approved butcher who knows how to do it and treats the animal as well as possible.
Some things that are forbidden to eat are pork and blood food, such as blood pudding.
It is not halal.
Fasting means not eating or drinking.
A prophet is a person who has been commissioned by a god to deliver the god's message.
A role model is a person you look up to and want to emulate.
