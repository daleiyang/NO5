Boys learn about Hinduism
When a boy is around ten years old, he gets to attend an education with a priest who teaches him about Hinduism.
The boy learns different texts by heart.
He also practices sitting in a special position with his legs crossed and thinking about the content of the texts.
Sitting in a special position and thinking concentratedly is called meditation.
At the end of the ceremony, a fire is lit, and the boy receives a string that he must wear on his torso for the rest of his life.
Girls do not attend this education, as it is not their responsibility to read religious books, according to Hinduism.
Wedding
For a Hindu, it is important to get married.
According to Hinduism, it is good for society that people are married.
In India, the parents are involved in suggesting whom to marry.
When two people marry, two families unite, and therefore everyone should have a say in the decision.
The wedding lasts several days and is a really big party.
It is not uncommon to have several hundred guests at a wedding in India.
A priest leads the wedding ceremony that is held in a temple or another location.
The priest reads texts, and the couple walks three laps around a fire and loudly prays for healthy children and that they will love each other for a long time â€“ for a hundred years.
As an offering to a god, they pour butter into the fire.
Funeral
At a Hindu funeral, relatives and friends gather.
A priest reads texts and then everyone sings songs together.
The body is then cremated, and the ashes are scattered in a river or at the place where the deceased lived.
Many Indians want their ashes scattered in the River Ganges.
The Ganges is considered a sacred river according to Hinduism.
Sometimes the body is placed on a raft, which is then set on fire in the river.
This way, the ashes end up in the river.
