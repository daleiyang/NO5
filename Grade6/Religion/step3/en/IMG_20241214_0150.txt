NAJDEN - A CONTACT MAN
Näjden was an important person among the Sámi.
He was appointed by the spirits and had many tasks.
He was a doctor, a shaman, and the one who led rituals.
Näjden's most important task was to have contact with the gods and the dead.
Näjden beat a special drum and sang a song called jojk.
A jojk is a monotonous song that is the Sámi's own type of music.
When Näjden beat the drum and sang, he could let his own soul travel to other worlds to meet gods and the dead.
GODS AND SPIRITS HELPED THE SAMI
The men worshipped their gods and the women theirs.
The gods could help with everything from changing the gender of small newborn children to making fishing go well.
Spirits were especially important to the people because they protected animals and plants.
Even dead people could be helpful.
For example, they could guard children and reindeer.
A ritual is to do something in a certain order.
Jojk is a special way of singing.
