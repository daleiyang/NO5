The Story of the Good Samaritan.
Christians believe that there is a heaven one can go to when one dies.
One time a man asked Jesus how to get there.
– You should love your fellow humans, answered Jesus.
– Who are my fellow humans? asked the man.
In response, Jesus told this story.
A man was on his way home to Jericho from Jerusalem.
Suddenly, he was attacked by robbers.
The robbers took the man's valuables and beat him.
Then they left him lying on the road badly injured.
After a while, a priest came walking by.
When he saw the injured man, he looked away and quickly passed by.
He let the man lie on the road without doing anything.
A little later, another priest came by.
He did not help the injured man either, even though the man needed help.
After a while longer, a third man came by.
The man was a Samaritan.
That means he came from the land of Samaria, which was north of Jerusalem.
At this time, most people in Jerusalem did not like Samaritans.
They thought they were strange foreigners because they did not have the same customs and traditions as those living in Jerusalem.
SAMARIA
Samaria was a land located north of Jerusalem.
The people who lived in Samaria had different traditions from those who lived in Jerusalem.
One is compassionate if one is understanding and helpful.
A custom is a tradition.
Something one does in the same way each time.
