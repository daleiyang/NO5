Hindu festivals
There are many festivals in Hinduism, and not all Hindus celebrate the same holidays.
But there are some that most celebrate.
Here you can read about two of them.
THE COLOR FESTIVAL (HOLI)
When? In the spring, in March.
It is common to celebrate for two days, but sometimes the festival lasts longer.
Why? The god Krishna is very important to many Hindus during this festival.
There are many different stories about Krishna.
According to one story, Krishna compared his face with his girlfriend Radha's face.
Krishna's face was dark while Radha's was light.
Krishna asked his mother why this was.
Krishna's mother then told him to paint Radha's face with color.
That is one of the reasons why colors are so important during this festival.
How? The Color Festival is a very joyful festival.
Hindus light big fires outdoors and dance and celebrate in the streets.
It is also customary to eat roasted coconuts, sugar, and other sweet things.
A tradition during the festival is to throw colored water or powder at each other.
People throw color to remember that Krishna painted Radha's face.
The Color Festival is celebrated in spring, when many catch colds.
The colors used are made from plants said to cure colds and other illnesses.
The colors also symbolize spring.
They are as colorful as all the flowers that come in spring.
A symbol is something used as a sign for something.
A â™¥ for example is a symbol for love, to like.
