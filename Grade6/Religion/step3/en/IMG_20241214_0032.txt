In the Catholic Church, there are seven sacraments.
1. BAPTISM
Catholics are baptized when they are young.
Through baptism, the child becomes Christian.
During the baptism, the priest pours water on the child's head.
2. CONFESSION
To confess means to admit one's sins to a priest.
A sin is when you have done something foolish or wrong, maybe lied or deceived someone.
When the person confessing has finished speaking, the priest says that God has forgiven the person for the wrongs they have done.
Each Catholic can decide for themselves how often they want to confess.
Some confess often, while others only confess once a year.
The priest sits on one side of the wall and listens.
On the other side sits the person confessing.
When we say that someone belongs to a church, we don't mean the building but the religion.
A sacrament is a holy action and a ceremony performed by priests.
