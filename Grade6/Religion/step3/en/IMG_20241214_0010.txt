It is called an altarpiece.
On an altarpiece, there are paintings that often describe events in Jesus' life.
Here Jesus hangs on a cross.
That was how Jesus died.
A cross with Jesus on it is called a crucifix.
The large semicircle around the altar is called an altar ring.
There you kneel during a ceremony called communion.
Then you partake in bread and wine, which Jesus and his friends ate at the Last Supper.
