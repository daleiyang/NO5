What did people believe in Sweden in the past?
For several hundred years, most people in the Nordic countries have been Christians.
But it has not always been so.
About 1,000 years ago, people believed in several different gods.
These gods were called Æsir, and therefore the old Nordic belief is called Asatru.
HOW THE WORLD LOOKED ACCORDING TO ASATRU
The people in the Nordics believed that their lives were governed by the gods.
Therefore, it was important to keep the gods in a good mood.
They did this, among other things, by offering sacrifices to them.
It was called "blot."
The place where people lived was called Midgard.
The gods lived in Asgard.
In Asgard, there was a very large tree called Yggdrasil.
This tree had branches that spread over the whole world.
One could say that the tree kept the world alive.
The tree also had long roots, and some roots reached all the way into the underworld.
Utgard was the name of the world outside of Midgard.
There lived giants and other nasty creatures.
Those who lived in Utgard were enemies of humans and the Æsir gods.
