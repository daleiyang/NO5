The story of Prince Vessantara
One of the most beloved stories in Buddhism is that of Prince Vessantara.
He was very unselfish.
He cared more about other people than himself and gave away everything he owned.
In Buddhism, one should gladly be unselfish, and therefore many Buddhists particularly like this story.
Vessantara was a prince who lived in India.
The first thing he asked his mother when he was born was if he could get something to give away.
His mother then gave him a thousand coins, and Vessantara gave them away.
When Prince Vessantara was five years old, he received a valuable necklace from his parents.
He immediately gave it away to a servant.
The servant initially did not want to accept the necklace and tried to return it.
But he couldn't.
When the prince was sixteen years old, he became king.
He married a girl and after a few years, they had two children.
The prince was so generous that he gave away his wife and children.
