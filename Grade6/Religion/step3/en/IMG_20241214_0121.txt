The next day Siddharta went back to the park.
Then he saw both a sick and a dead person.
Now he understood that all people can get sick and all people will die.
No one had told him this.
The last person Siddharta met that day was an ascetic.
It is a person who seeks the meaning of life by living in poverty and eating very little.
It was a common way at the time to try to find the meaning of life.
Siddharta leaves his family and seeks the meaning of life
Siddharta's encounter with old age, sickness, and death made him start to think about life.
He decided to go away alone to seek the truth about the meaning of life.
One dark night Siddharta left his family.
First, he found some teachers to teach him.
But nothing they taught him gave him the answer he sought.
Then he tried to live as an ascetic and eat very little.
But after a while, his body couldn't take it anymore, and he collapsed.
Then he realized that this could not be the right way.
Finally, Siddharta sat under a fig tree to meditate.
Then an evil demon named Mara appeared.
Mara tried to trick Siddharta into stopping thinking.
Mara knew that Siddharta was close to discovering the truth about the meaning of life.
The demon Mara sent stormy winds, but nothing could make Siddharta stop meditating.
An ascetic is a person who lives very simply and poorly.
The opposite of living in luxury and abundance.
To meditate means to sit in a special position and concentrate on a thought or a word, such as important questions like the meaning of life.
