Jesus was born in Bethlehem.
In the Bible, one can read about when Jesus was born.
His mother, Mary, was visited by an angel.
The angel told her she would have a child.
The child was very special and was to be named Jesus.
One day when Mary and her husband Joseph were visiting the city of Bethlehem, it was time for Mary to give birth.
They stayed in a simple house that we would call a stable, and there Jesus was born.
Jesus then grew up in the city of Nazareth.
Jesus had four brothers: James, Joses, Judas, and Simon.
He also had at least two or three sisters whose names we do not know.
The Bible says nothing about when Jesus was a child.
But there is a story about him when he was twelve years old and visited the great temple in Jerusalem with his parents.
It is said that Jesus was a wise boy and that he asked the priests in the temple curious questions.
Jesus had twelve disciples.
When Jesus was about 30 years old, he began to travel around the country and talk about God.
He invited twelve men to follow him.
The twelve men are called disciples.
The disciples received a special mission.
It was to learn everything that Jesus spoke about so that they could later tell others about it.
For several years, Jesus went with his twelve disciples around the country and talked to people about God and how God wanted people to treat each other.
Many listened to what he had to say.
A temple is a large building where one can pray.
A disciple is a person who follows a teacher.
Jesus had 12 disciples who followed him and listened to what he said.
