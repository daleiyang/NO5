The Samaritan saw the man lying on the road and was filled with compassion.
He went up to him, washed his wounds and bandaged them.
Then he lifted him up on his donkey and took him to an inn to take care of him.
The next day, the Samaritan had to continue his journey.
He then gave money to the man who owned the inn so that he would take care of the injured man until he recovered.
Jesus wanted to talk about helpfulness.
When Jesus had finished the story, he asked which of the men in the story would come to the kingdom of heaven.
The man replied that naturally it would be the Samaritan.
What Jesus wanted to convey was that one should help people in their surroundings, even if one does not know them.
One does not go to heaven just because one is a priest, rich, or has a certain status.
But the most important thing is to help your fellow humans, and anyone can do that regardless of who they are or where they come from.
What do you think?
Have you ever ignored helping someone who you knew needed help?
Why don't we always help each other?
Compassion is something you can feel for other people.
It means that you understand how these people feel.
A person with high status is someone whom other people look up to.
You can attain high status if you have a good job or are skilled in something.
