Everything goes in circles.
Buddhists believe, just like Hindus, that life goes on again and again.
Humans are born into many lives on earth.
This is called samsara, which means an eternal cycle, something that never ends.
But humans break out of this cycle and stop being reborn when they reach nirvana.
What we do matters.
Just like for a Hindu, it is important for a Buddhist to live righteously and to think and act lovingly.
Everything one does matters for this life and what happens in the next life.
This is called karma.
Karma is the sum of life's good and bad actions and it determines what a person is born as in the next life.
It's not even certain that one becomes a human in the next life; one can also become an animal.
It is karma that determines that.
According to Buddha, there is no god or gods.
Despite this, it is common for Buddhists to pray to gods.
Some also pray to Buddha.
They see Buddha as a god.
This couple lights candles and incense to improve their karma.
Samsara means eternal cycle, which means that everything goes in circles without end.
Karma is the sum of all the good and bad actions a person has done in their life.
