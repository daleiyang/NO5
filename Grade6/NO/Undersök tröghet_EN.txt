The coin in the glass



You need: a coin, a piece of cardboard and a larger beaker and a smaller one.



Do this:



1. Place the piece of cardboard on top of the larger cup.



2. Then the coin on the carton.



3. Try to pull the piece of cardboard away so quickly that the coin ends up in the beaker.



4. Try until you succeed.



5. Do the same with the smaller beaker.



6. Document:



a. Describe how it went. Do you need to change your tactics to make it work?



b. What do you do differently from the first time to the time you succeeded? Tell us about the changes/improvements you had to make.



c. How many attempts did you make?



d. Can the survey be changed in any way to make it more difficult?



Results:



1 2 3 4: first attempt.



5: A next smallest first attempt.



 B minimum first attempt.



Everything is so easy



Improvements/Changes:



Pull the paper away



You need: a piece of paper and a paper cup filled to about ¼ with water.



Do this:



1. Place a piece of paper on a table.



2. Place a paper cup with water on the paper. Make sure the bottom of the paper cup is completely dry.



3. With a quick movement, try to pull the paper away without spilling the water in the mug.



4. If you can do it, test how much water you can hold in the mug.



5. Document:



a. Describe how it went. Do you need to change your tactics to make it work?



b. What do you do differently from the first time to the time you succeeded? Tell us about the changes/improvements you had to make



c. How many attempts did you make?



d. Can the survey be changed in any way to make it more difficult?



Results:



It works better if there is ¼ of the water and the paper is not wet.



Does not work if paper is wet and too much water.
