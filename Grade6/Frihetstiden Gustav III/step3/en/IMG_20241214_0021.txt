"Now the ladies have certainly drunk their last coffee!" one of them exclaims contentedly.
"Coffee?" replies the hostess. "What coffee?"
The men look around the room.
"It certainly smells like coffee here. Bring out the pot now! This will be a hefty fine!"
"Prove it, if I may ask!" The hostess steps forward and narrows her eyes at the sausages.

"Can you see anything that shows that my friends and I have broken the law on forbidden coffee?"
"No... Not see, exactly. But smell." The man's large nostrils grow even larger as he inhales the coffee scent, but he starts to appear uncertain.
"Then! I think he should take his men and leave. Before it gets embarrassing."
The blue-clad men glare angrily, but they file out through the door.
The hostess listens for their disappearing steps on the stairs before she turns around.
"My ladies! I think it might be time for a little refill, don't you?"
