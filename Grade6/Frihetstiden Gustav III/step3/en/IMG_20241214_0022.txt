A new royal couple.
Sweden had lost the war against Russia.
The condition for Sweden to keep Finland was that the Russian Empress Elisabeth could decide who would become king after King Fredrik, who had no children of his own.
The Empress wanted one of her relatives, a German prince named Adolf Fredrik.
And so it was.
Adolf Fredrik and Lovisa Ulrika.
In 1751, Sweden's new king was Adolf Fredrik.
He is quite kind and calm and has no major issues with not deciding everything himself.
Perhaps he thrives best when he is engaged in music or turning beautiful snuffboxes from wood?
Adolf Fredrik is married to Lovisa Ulrika.
But she is the sister of the powerful prince of Prussia in Germany, and becomes increasingly dissatisfied that the king in Sweden has so little say.
Lovisa Ulrika wants the Swedish court to be as fine as in other countries in Europe.
She strives to invigorate both art and science in Sweden and brings in actors and opera singers from France and Italy.
The Queen is also very interested in natural sciences and founded the Academy of Sciences to encourage inventions and research expeditions.
