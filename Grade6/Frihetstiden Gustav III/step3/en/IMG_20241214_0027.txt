The Inventor Polhem
Christopher Polhem was a very skilled inventor.
He invented both big and small things.
He built the new lock in Stockholm, and he is also known for a new smart padlock, the Polhem Lock.
At that time, many machines were powered by the force of running water.
Polhem figured out how to transfer that power through a system of rotating rods that hooked into each other.
He is a very good example of how the ideas of the Enlightenment were mainly used for useful things in Sweden.
Hi!
My hairstyle is powdered with a fine potato powder.
It was Eva Ekeblad who figured out that potatoes could be used for powder!
The Potato Queen Ekeblad
Countess Eva Ekeblad submitted bread, spirits, starch, and powder to the Academy of Sciences.
She had made everything from potatoes!
They thought it was incredible that such good things as powder and spirits could be made from a plant that no one had cared about.
They elected Eva Ekeblad as the first woman in the academy.
In the picture, you see spirit boilers.
They existed in almost every home in the 1700s.
