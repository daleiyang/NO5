A street in Söder in Stockholm.
Most houses were still small simple cottages made of wood.
Street lighting had not yet been invented, so it was not fun to be out in the evening.
The Spinner
Here comes a woman walking with quick steps.
She is on her way from her small cottage on Södermalm in Stockholm to a large stone house in Gamla Stan.
A woven basket hangs on a string around her neck and in her arm she carries a child, only a couple of months old.
When she arrives where she is going, she knocks on the door.
A man opens and shows her into a large room.
The air inside is completely filled with swirling dust, and the little child on the woman's arm has to sneeze.
From floor to ceiling, the room is packed with wool in large bundles, stacked on top of each other.
The man packs the woman's basket full of wool.
