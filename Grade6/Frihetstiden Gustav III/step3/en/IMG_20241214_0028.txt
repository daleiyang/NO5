Gustav III
When Adolf Fredrik died in 1771, his son Gustav became king.
Gustav is the third Swedish king with that name.
Before him, Gustav Vasa and Gustav II Adolf reigned, and now he has become Gustav III.
Gustav had been king for only a year when, in August 1772, he staged a coup took over power from the council and the various estates.
With the help of officers and soldiers in his own guard, he managed to arrest the members of the council.
Now Gustav III had the power to decide how the country should be governed.
To begin with, he himself would decide who could sit on the council.
The political parties, hats and caps, were banned.
The king became almost absolute, even though the parliament remained.
Starting a war was one of the few things the king could not do on his own.
A brilliant court
Gustav wanted a large and brilliant court, just like the kings in France.
He wanted to gather all the noble and elegant people in the country around him and live a life that was luxurious and extravagant from morning to evening.
It already started when the king got out of bed.
Then he would be surrounded by a crowd of fine gentlemen who got to watch while the king's servants washed and dressed him.
Once a week, the entire court gathered to watch the king and his family eat dinner.
What would you think of having a bunch of people watching when you got out of bed and washed yourself?
