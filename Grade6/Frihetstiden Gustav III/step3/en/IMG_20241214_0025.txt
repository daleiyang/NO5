Linné visits Queen Lovisa Ulrika at Drottningholm Palace.
He helped the queen sort her collection of remarkable things from nature.
Did you know that...
...the one who has a hundred-kronor note knows what Carl von Linné looks like?
In 1741, Linné became a professor of natural history in Uppsala, and many of his students traveled to the most remote parts of the world.
Some fell ill and died while others returned home with exciting findings and discoveries from, for example, China, South Africa, and Japan.
Carl named several of the plants after his students.
Therefore, there are plants named Osbeckia and Thunbergia.
