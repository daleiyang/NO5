The Flower King Linné
Carl von Linné is probably one of the world's most famous Swedes.
This is because he was the first to come up with a way to organize plants into different families, making it easier to keep track of which plants are related to each other.
Linné was originally a doctor, but he was most interested in traveling around and finding new rare plants that he could add to his discoveries.
He traveled around Lapland, in Öland and Gotland, in Västergötland and Skåne.
Everything he saw, he drew and wrote about in many books.
Linné was one of those who, together with Queen Lovisa Ulrika, founded the Academy of Sciences.
He was also tasked with sorting the queen's own large collection of natural history items.
These were called natural science objects, minerals, fossils, pressed plants, or animals preserved in spirits.
This little flower was Linné's favorite flower.
Therefore, he made sure that another scientist named the little flower Linnea, because he could not do it himself.
Here are Linné's glasses on top of one of his notebooks.
They look really modern, don't they?
