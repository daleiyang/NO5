There, he says.
There are ten pounds in the basket and Mr. Pauli says you must be finished in two weeks.
The woman nods and reaches out her hand to take the basket.
But the old man shakes his head.
You must leave a pledge.
What do you have?
The woman sighs and fumbles with her hand in the pocket of her apron.
Here...
She holds out a thin little silver chain.
The old man looks at it critically.
Not worth much.
Barely as much as the wool, he mutters.
For me, it is.
It's the little one's christening gift.
The old man shrugs and takes the chain.
The woman hurries to hang the basket around her neck and soon she is back home in her little cottage in Söder.
In her room, there is only a bed, a chair, and a spinning wheel.
When she has fed the child, she lays it on the floor.
Then she takes a substantial tuft of wool from the basket, and soon the spinning wheel's wheel spins while the wool threads are spun into yarn.
The woman's foot pedals keep the wheel going while her diligent fingers feed threads from the wool tuft.
She must spin many hours a day to be finished in time.
If she is delayed, Mr. Pauli won't get any yarn for his weavers to weave fabric from, so his tailor can eventually sew clothes.
The woman in the little house in Söder was just one of many who worked at home in this way to make money.
Working at home
The first workers often sat at home and worked with, for example, cleaning, combing, or spinning wool.
The owner handed out the raw material, that is, the material the worker needed.
To ensure the workers wouldn't keep any of the raw materials themselves, they had to leave a pledge, which was something valuable.
They got the pledge back when they came with the finished result of their work.
What was made at home was often half-finished and passed on to places where more people sat and completed it.
It was called manufactory and means to manufacture by hand.
