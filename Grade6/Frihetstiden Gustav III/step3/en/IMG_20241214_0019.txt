"Please do step into the drawing-room, mes amis."
The other guests have already arrived.
Mes amis means my friends.
It's important to know a little French if you want to understand what fine people say.
The woman shows us into a larger room.
It is beautifully furnished with silk wallpaper on the walls, soft upholstered chairs, tables of shiny wood with carved, curved legs.
Around the table sit some other women in the finest attire.
"Well, ladies! Now we can soon let ourselves taste," says the merchant's wife.
It's forbidden!
A door opens and the merchant steps in.
A bright red velvet vest stretches over the thick belly.
The shirt is snow white and under the chin puffs a lace jabot.
On the head sits a wig slightly askew.
He looks worriedly at his wife.
"Dear Adolphine," he says.
"Is it really a good idea to serve coffee? It is after all..."
"So..."
The woman waves dismissively at her husband.
Go to the tavern, you, my dear, and talk business.
That's where you are most comfortable, isn't it?"
The merchant slams the door behind him.
All the ladies around the table start talking and laughing at once, until the hostess rings a brass bell.
Then it becomes expectantly quiet.
Another door opens and in comes a whole little parade of maidservants with neat white caps on their heads and clean aprons.
The hostess looks on contentedly as they set out small white porcelain coffee cups with blue patterns.
Cake plates and cakes are placed in the middle of the table, and finally a huge copper coffee pot is brought in.
Guess how I get my dress to be so big?
Well, I've got a petticoat made of those long spouts that whales have in their mouths. It's true!
But it's not very comfortable when you sit down...
