Hats and Caps
The first person to lead the effort to govern Sweden was named Arvid Horn.
He was an old warrior who had had enough of war.
He wanted peace and order in the country.
But there were many who were disappointed that Sweden was no longer a great power.
It was usually young nobles who had not been out in the war themselves.
They thought that Arvid Horn and all who agreed with him were slow and tired types, speaking nonsense.
The young nobles began to call Horn's group the Caps.
They themselves called themselves Hats.
A real man and warrior would wear a hat, and be a man for his hat, as they used to say.
Hats in Power
After the Hats and Caps had quarreled with each other in the parliament for several years, the Hats finally came to power.
The Hats thought that Sweden should not buy so many luxury goods from other countries because then the Swedes' silver coins would disappear abroad.
Therefore, they paid a lot of money to start more factories that could make Swedish goods instead.
They also wanted to take back countries that the Swedes had lost to Russia.
Therefore, they started a war against Russia in 1741.
But Sweden lost the war and was finished as a great power.
Uprising in Dalarna
In the villages of Dalarna, people were angry because many men had been injured and killed in the war against Russia.
They wanted the generals to be punished.
The Dalarna farmers sent the message stick, as they had done since the Middle Ages.
Did you know that...
...you used to wear a hat to bed in the old days?
It got cold in the room when the fire in the stove burned out.
And your head would stick up above the covers.
Powder for the face and wigs were bought from abroad.
It was a waste, the Hat Party thought.
