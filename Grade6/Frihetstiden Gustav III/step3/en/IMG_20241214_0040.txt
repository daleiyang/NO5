THE AGE OF LIBERTY
Gustav III
Tomas Blom
In this book, you meet people who lived in Sweden during the Age of Liberty.
They are free from the king's autocracy because the king has lost much of his power.
The country is instead governed by the parliament and there are two parties, the Hats and Caps.
King Gustav III regains power but is shot at a masquerade.
You also get to visit a wealthy merchant where people are forced to drink coffee in the utmost secrecy.
