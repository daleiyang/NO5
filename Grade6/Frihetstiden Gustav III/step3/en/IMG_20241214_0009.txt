The peasants' plots are redistributed.
Since the Middle Ages, the peasants' land has been divided into many small pieces called strips.
The farmers who live in a village have divided the strips amongst themselves so that everyone gets an equal amount of the best and worst land.
The problem is that there are too many small plots for each peasant to manage.
Now the parliament wants the peasants to redistribute their land in a new way.
The strips should be merged into larger plots to make cultivation easier.
This is called land consolidation, and soon many farmers think it seems sensible and follow the parliament's proposal.
Others do not like it, but have to adapt.
But as the population grows, the land is not enough for everyone.
There will be many people in the countryside who do not own any land at all.
What will they find to live on?
The man and his wife bow to their master.
They live by working on his fields.
As payment, they get to live in one of the gray cottages, and they receive food and a small amount of money.
In the field, a man goes and reaps the grain with a scythe.
In the background, two oxen pull a wagon with a load of hay.
