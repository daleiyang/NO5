In many other countries in Europe, the peasants are serfs.
This means they obey a nobleman.
He rules over them and they cannot move from his farm without permission.
Sweden is one of the few places where peasants have representatives in parliament.
The parliament and the council
One of the most important things happening in Sweden during the Age of Liberty is that the parliament actually governs the country, in much the same way it does today.
Ever since the Middle Ages, the highest nobles have formed a small group called the Council of State.
This council has helped the king to govern the realm.
It still exists now and functions as a kind of government.
But the new development during the Age of Liberty is that the parliament can dismiss the men in the Council of State if they do not make good decisions.
The king participates in voting on what the council should decide, but there is nothing that says his proposal will win.
A new time
It has never been like this in Sweden before.
Recently, the king decided everything himself, now certain parts of the population get to participate and influence how the country should be governed.
But the four estates remain, and it is finer to be a nobleman than a peasant.
But during the 18th century, more and more people do not belong to any estate at all.
These are maids and farmhands in the countryside and simple, poor people in the cities who have nothing to say about governance.
It will take a long time before anyone cares about what they think.
The four estates
Nobles, priests, burghers, and peasants have existed since the Middle Ages.
Only those who belonged to the four estates were allowed to participate in decision-making in the parliament.
But during the 18th century, there started to be such people who did not belong to any estate at all.
They become more and more numerous and also want to have a say.
