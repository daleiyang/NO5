It means that a message was passed from farm to farm that it was time for every man to take his rifle and his backpack and go to war.
Nearly five thousand men marched towards Stockholm.
Many nobles fled when the Dala farmers marched into the city, but the people crowded the streets and cheered.
The king's soldiers did not obey orders but refused to shoot the farmers.
The Dala farmers moved into people's homes and stayed in Stockholm for several days to make the government agree to their demands.
But they had no proper leadership, and as they discussed with the government, time passed.
Eventually, the government managed to gather soldiers who obeyed, and the Dala farmers' rebellion ended with the soldiers opening fire on them.
Nearly 140 died, and many were punished with whipping and forced labor.
After that, it became forbidden to send the message stick in Dalarna.
It was a long way to go from Dalarna to Stockholm.
But the Dala farmers really wanted to show what they thought.
