The queen wants to take power.
In 1756, the Hat Party had power in the parliament.
They do not get along with the queen at all.
The parliament wants to involve themselves in how her and the kingâ€™s three sons should be raised.
Of course, Lovisa Ulrika does not like this.
Several of the noblemen want a stronger royal power, and together with the queen, they plan to take power by force.
But their plans are revealed and several of the noblemen are arrested and executed.
The queen must apologize to the parliament, and from now on, the king has less power than ever.
The parliament makes a stamp with the king's signature.
Now they can stamp the king's name without even bothering to ask him what he thinks.
The king has no power. But you still have to bow to him.
This is what Adolf Fredrik's name stamp looked like.
The royal couple's eldest son, Gustav, is 10 years old when this happens, and he probably does not like seeing his parents being treated this way by the parliament.
Perhaps he hopes to have more power himself when he becomes king?
The Enlightenment.
In the 18th century, thinkers and scientists became more and more curious about how the great and fantastic world worked.
They also began to think about what humans were really like, deep inside.
Was she so wicked and selfish that she needed to be ruled by powerful leaders?
Or was it perhaps that humans were actually good and benevolent creatures who thrived best when allowed to develop in freedom?
The most important thing for scientists in the 18th century was that their work should be useful and spread knowledge.
One of the famous thinkers from the 18th century was named Rousseau.
He believed that every person is born free and has the right to participate in decisions in society.
The will of the people should prevail, and of course, the absolute monarchs did not like that.
