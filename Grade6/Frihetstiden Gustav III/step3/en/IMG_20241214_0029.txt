Theater King
When Gustav was young, he used to dress up and give long speeches for his toys.
He couldn't become a real actor, as he was a king, but theater was his great interest.
Gustav had a fine small theater built at Gripsholm Castle, he renovated the theater at Drottningholm (where one can still see performances today) and he ensured that Stockholm got a new beautiful opera house.
Culture in Swedish
Gustav III wanted the Swedish language and culture to develop.
In 1786, the king founded a society he called the Swedish Academy.
It consisted of eighteen learned men who would ensure more and better Swedish authors emerged.
Another task of the academy was to compile a dictionary of the Swedish language, something it still does.
(Today, the Swedish Academy is otherwise best known for awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature.)
The king was also generous with money to many kinds of artists, such as the sculptor Sergel and the poet Bellman.
