The man in the carriage has a nice blue coat and a triangular hat on his head, as fine gentlemen usually have.
He is the one who owns the whole farm.

New times in the countryside.
When the age of great power ends, it is quite miserable in Sweden.
All wars have taken the lives of many men.
Many people have also died from plague and famine.
Moreover, the Russian fleet has ravaged and burned along the Swedish coast, before peace truly came in 1721.
But now the farmers can finally cultivate their land in peace and quiet, so that people get enough food.
More food and fewer wars and diseases mean that there are more people in Sweden.
In the early 1700s, one million people live in the country (which consists of both Sweden and Finland).
A hundred years later, the population has increased to nearly three million.
