Sweden trades with China.
In 1731, the Swedish East India Company is formed in Gothenburg.
Now it's time for the Swedes to start bringing home goods from China themselves.
Many dangers await on the way, storm, pirates, and diseases.
But good ships are built in Sweden, and no ship sails away without being equipped with cannons to fend off pirates.
It could take several years to sail back and forth to China, but when they got home, the goods sold quickly and the merchants made lots of money.
The sailors were also satisfied.
They were indeed poorly paid compared to the captain and the mate, but they could bring home their own goods and sell them themselves.
The fine Chinese porcelain.
The China journeys from Gothenburg continued for almost a hundred years.
Chinese goods became more and more popular.
Having a set of genuine Chinese porcelain was a status symbol, and many wealthy people began furnishing their homes with furniture and fabrics from China.
