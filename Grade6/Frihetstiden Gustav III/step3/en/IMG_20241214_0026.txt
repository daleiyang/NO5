Fact about.
Many new inventions.
In the 1700s, many people began to think in a new way and now many want to explore how the world actually looks.
They use their own eyes instead of blindly trusting old ideas.
This way of thinking helps when inventing new things and creating inventions that make life easier.
Silk weaving.
The women in the picture are weaving silk with the help of machines that the silk weaver Almgren smuggled home to Stockholm from France, where they had been invented.
Another man named Jonas Alströmer received contributions from the hat party to start Swedish factories.
He had been in England and seen how they did it there.
But his fabrics and socks were not as beautiful and good as the foreign ones.
Today, Alströmer is more famous for trying to get Swedes to eat potatoes.
He was also the one who called the plant potato after the English name potatoes.
