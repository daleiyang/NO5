Hello, my name is Aron Isak and I am Jewish.
I moved to Sweden in 1774 to work as an engraver.
The Swedish authorities wanted to force me to become Christian in order to stay.
But King Gustav III helped me.
I became the first Jew allowed to live in Sweden.
Gustav decides
Gustav III had the power to decide.
He decided that it was forbidden to use torture to force people to confess to crimes.
It became permissible to belong to the Catholic Church and Jews were allowed to keep their religion.
Gustav also decided that everything written had to be approved before it could be published in the newspaper.
Many were dissatisfied
Gustav thought it was foolish for the peasants to use grain to make spirits and prohibited this.
But at the same time, he started factories to profit from the sale of spirits himself.
The peasants, of course, became very dissatisfied.
The priests, burghers, and nobility were also unhappy with Gustav's rule.
Gustav had to do something about the dissatisfaction.
He removed the ban on distilling spirits at home so the peasants were pleased, and he also managed to get the burghers and priests on his side.
But the nobility was more dissatisfied than ever.
Then Gustav decided to start a war against Russia.
He hoped the nobility would forget their complaints.
The problem was that the king could not start a war without the parliament's approval.
But Gustav had Swedish soldiers put on Russian uniforms and pretend to attack their own, making it look like Russia had struck first.
But the war was poorly planned and Gustav gained nothing from it.
