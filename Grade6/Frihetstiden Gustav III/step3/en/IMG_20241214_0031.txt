Anckarström's pistol was loaded with small nails and iron scrap.
When he fired, he threw away the pistol, which ended up on the floor.
The shot at the opera
Some of the noblemen who were most dissatisfied with Gustav III had begun to meet in secret and plan how they would kill the king and establish a new government.
On March 16, 1792, there would be a masquerade at the Opera in Stockholm, and the king would go there.
And the conspiratorial noblemen decided that was when the murder would happen.
The king received a warning letter but went to the masquerade anyway.
The conspirators gather around the king.
Everyone is dressed in black masks and long black coats.
The king is standing and talking to one of his courtiers when someone says: "Good evening, beautiful mask."
In the next second, the shot goes off, and the king is hit in the left hip.
For fourteen days, doctors try to save his life, but eventually Gustav III dies from the infected wound.
Who killed the king?
A nobleman named Anckarström confessed that he shot Gustav III and was beheaded.
But none of the others were punished as harshly.
Several of them were pardoned by the king’s own brother, Duke Karl.
Some left Sweden and settled abroad.
This costume was worn by King Gustav III when he was shot at the Opera masquerade.
