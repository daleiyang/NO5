Who should decide?
In 1718, King Karl XII was killed by a bullet at the fortress of Fredriksten in Norway.
He has no children to inherit the crown.
Instead, it is his sister who begins to reign.
Her name is Ulrika Eleonora, and before she ascends the throne she must promise that she will not continue to decide everything by herself as her brother did.
Ulrika Eleonora does not reign for long, but soon lets her husband Fredrik become king.
Fredrik comes from Germany and when he becomes king he will be called Fredrik I.
All four estates in the parliament
People are still divided into four estates: nobility, clergy, burghers, and peasants.
The kings in Sweden have often let the estates participate in decision-making.
Then the estates have chosen which men will go to Stockholm and sit in the parliament.
This also applies to the peasants.
When Ulrika Eleonora signed and sealed this elegant document, she agreed not to decide herself how Sweden would be governed.
