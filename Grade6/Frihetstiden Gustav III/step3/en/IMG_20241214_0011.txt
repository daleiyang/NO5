"Make way at the rowing stairs! Clear the way for boatmen, shoeshiners, customs officers and sailors!" 
Thus sang Bellman about 18th century Stockholm.
In long rows the ships lay along Skeppsbron and unloaded their cargo.
The dock workers raced past each other with their burdens, it smelled of tar, coffee, spices, and freshly cut timber.
Today Skeppsbron mostly smells of exhaust fumes.
