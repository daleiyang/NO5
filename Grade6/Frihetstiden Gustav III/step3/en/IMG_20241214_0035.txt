The radio, TV, and computer.
During the 20th century, inventions changed people's daily lives.
Those who could afford it had a phone.
People could go to the cinema and watch black-and-white films.
When the radio came, you got headphones to listen to the programs.
In the early 1950s, the first TV sets arrived, but it took many years before people could watch color TV programs.
And when the first Swedish computer came, it was as big as a summer cottage.
Today, no one knows how small a computer can become.
History yesterday and tomorrow.
It is usually said that history tries to answer two questions.
They are: How was it then? How did we get here?
We can never fully answer the first question.
We cannot really know how everything was in the past.
But we can investigate what remains, use our imagination, and try to think of how people had it.
The second question may be easier to answer.
For example, we can see that Sweden is a democratically governed country because people fought for voting rights a hundred years ago.
We can also learn from history to make our own future as good as possible.
Imagine if you could see into the future!
I wonder what they will write about our time in their history books.
