A new Gustav on the throne
Gustav III had only one son, who was named Gustav Adolf.
He is only thirteen years old when his father dies, and for five years the country is ruled by Duke Karl.
In 1796, Gustav Adolf ascends the throne.
Naturally, he is named Gustav IV (the fourth) Adolf.
His reign is short and quite unhappy.
At this time, at the very beginning of the 1800s, the French emperor Napoleon is Europe's most powerful ruler.
His armies have triumphed everywhere and he has seized numerous countries.
King Gustav IV Adolf dislikes Napoleon very much and drags his country into another war against Russia, which is on Napoleon's side.
For two years, 1808 and 1809, Sweden fights against Russia, and when the war is over, Russia has won and taken all of Finland from Sweden.
Finland and Sweden have been one country since the Middle Ages, and many consider it a heavy loss.
Gustav IV Adolf is deposed
Despite Sweden not having a chance against Russia, King Gustav IV Adolf refuses to give up the fight.
Since he is as autocratic as his father, there is only one way to stop him.
Some officers simply enter the Stockholm Palace and capture the king.
When he realizes that his own people no longer want him, he abdicates in 1809 and lives the rest of his life abroad, where he calls himself Colonel Gustafsson.
Hello!  In 1809, we are exactly 200 years away from our own time.
You can bet a lot will happen in those years!
But you'll read about that in another book. Bye bye!
