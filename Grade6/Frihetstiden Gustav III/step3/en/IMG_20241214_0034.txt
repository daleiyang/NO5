How did it go then?
The Danish prince who was to become king after Gustav IV Adolf suddenly had a heart attack and died.
Then one of Emperor Napoleon's officers was asked if he wanted to become king in Sweden.
His name was Jean Baptiste Bernadotte and he immediately accepted.
As king, he was called Karl XIV Johan, and our Crown Princess Victoria can call him "great-great-great-great-grandfather."
Voting rights for all
When Karl XIV Johan became king, he could still decide a lot himself.
But soon more and more people began to demand to be involved in governing the country.
At the beginning of the 1900s, the government and the king had to agree to let all men vote.
Women in Sweden did not get the right to vote until 1921.
Many move to the cities
When Karl XIV Johan became king, almost everyone still lived in the countryside.
Agriculture provided more food, there was peace, and doctors could cure several diseases.
This meant that more people survived.
In the 1800s, many moved to the cities and started working in the new factories.
At the beginning of the 1900s, Sweden had become an industrial country.
Today, only about one in a hundred Swedes make a living from farming.
