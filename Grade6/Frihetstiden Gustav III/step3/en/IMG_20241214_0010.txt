New times in the cities
There are still very few cities in Sweden.
Only every tenth person is a city dweller.
The largest city is Stockholm, where about 70,000 people live.
Second is Gothenburg, with about 10,000 people.
But all other cities are much smaller, and many city dwellers in this time still live as much from their fields and livestock as from trade and crafts.
Stockholm is the capital
The king lives in Stockholm, and the parliament convenes here every three years.
In the city, there are many wealthy citizens engaged in foreign trade.
European countries want iron and copper from the mines in Bergslagen.
And they also buy timber and tar, which are the only things suitable for sealing wooden ships.
The wealthy citizens build many fine houses in Stockholm.
On Skeppsbron, merchants live, who can look out from their windows to see how their ships are lined up along the quay.
Outside the city, other citizens build fine farms to escape the bad air in the narrow alleys.
The houses get many comfortable and practical rooms, and finally, people do not have to freeze in the winter.
Now the tiled stove has been invented, and it soon becomes very popular.
But not many could afford many rooms and a tiled stove.
Most Stockholmers were ordinary people, craftsmen, journeymen, apprentices, office workers, dock workers, street vendors, farmhands, maids, and servants.
More and more also began to support themselves with a completely new profession.
They were factory workers.
The stove has painted porcelain tiles.
When you fire it, the hot air passes through long pipes inside the stove before being released into the chimney.
This way, the heat stays in the stove for a long time.
