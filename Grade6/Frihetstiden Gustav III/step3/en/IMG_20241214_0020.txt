Did you know that...
...in the 1700s it was sometimes forbidden to buy foreign goods such as coffee?
Those in power did not want Swedes to waste their money on such things.
A delicious smell of freshly brewed coffee fills the room and the ladies lift their small cups to their mouths.
“Mmmm. C'est delicieux!”
For a long time, all we hear are satisfied little sighs and the tinkling of silver spoons stirring the cups.
If only we could understand what it was the master was worried about?
What's so strange about offering some coffee?
“Isn't it a shame that this wonderful drink should not be allowed...”
one of the ladies around the table begins, but she is interrupted by footsteps outside the door, which is thrown open with great speed.
There stands one of the maids, red-faced and breathless.
The sausages are coming!
"Madam... the sausages are coming!" she pants.
"They have heard that there is coffee here.
They are already inside the gate!"
"Quick!" the hostess shouts.
"Lovisa, take the pot and run up to the attic with it.
The cups we hide in... in the tiled stove!"
The maid grabs the huge copper pot and disappears.
There is a fire crackling in a tiled stove in this room too.
All the small delicate cups end up inside the doors with great speed.
"But, Adolphine, won't they be ruined?" asks one of the guests.
"Oh! Real Chinese porcelain should withstand a little heat..."
Barely have the stove doors closed when the door swings open again and three men march in.
They have dark blue coats with brass buttons, they are probably police.
