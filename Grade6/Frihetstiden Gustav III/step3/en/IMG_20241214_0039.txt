The rulers of Sweden from 1719 to today.
During the Age of Liberty, the parliament governed the country.
Those who sat on the throne could not decide everything themselves.
But when Gustav III becomes king, he stages a coup against the rulers and begins to decide a lot himself.
THE AGE OF LIBERTY.
1719–1720 Ulrika Eleonora began to reign when her brother Karl XII was shot.
Ulrika had to promise not to decide everything herself.
The parliament governs the country.
1720–1751 Fredrik I was married to Ulrika Eleonora.
Ulrika did not reign long and handed over the crown to Fredrik.
1751–1771 Adolf Fredrik became king after Fredrik who never had any children.
Adolf Fredrik is related to the Russian empress.
Sweden had lost a war against Russia and had to comply with what the empress wanted to keep Finland.
THE GUSTAVIAN ERA.
1771–1792 Gustav III is the son of Adolf Fredrik and Lovisa Ulrika.
He stages a coup and takes power from the council and the estates.
Now the king decides almost everything again.
1792–1809 Gustav IV Adolf was only thirteen when his father, Gustav III, died, and for five years, the country was ruled by Gustav III's brother, Duke Karl.
In 1796, Gustav officially becomes king.
But when Gustav loses Finland to Russia, he is deposed.
1809–1818 Karl XIII, Gustav III's brother, becomes king again when Gustav IV Adolf is deposed.
The intention is for a Danish prince to become king, but he dies suddenly.
THE BERNADOTTE KINGS.
1818–1844 Karl XIV Johan was originally named Jean Baptiste Bernadotte.
He was an officer in Napoleon's army when he was elected king of Sweden after Karl XIII.
Since then, the Bernadotte family has been on the throne in Sweden.
But today, the parliament and government run the country.
