The coffee party.
Now we walk along a narrow street in Stockholm in the 1760s.
We no longer get muddy on our feet, as in the Middle Ages, because the street is covered with small round stones.
When a carriage comes rolling, the wheels rattle against the stones so that it echoes between the walls of the houses.
We are heading towards a large and magnificent house.
There lives a wealthy merchant and his family.
The lady of the house has invited us to a party.
First, we enter a courtyard.
There are both the merchant's warehouse and a stable with horses.
Then we discover the gate to the house where they live.
Now we must hurry inside.
First, we enter a hall with high vaults.
A wide staircase leads up to the first of the three floors.
We continue upwards and on the first landing we stand in front of a tall door in carved wood.
The door handle is made of porcelain and we gently press it and peek into a cozy little room.
Step into the salon!
It's warm in here!
For the first time during our journeys through history, we have entered a room that doesn't feel cold and damp.
The warmth comes from a tiled stove.
It has beautifully painted tiles and behind the brass doors burns a fire.
From the adjoining room comes the sound of tapping heels.
A beautiful lady opens the door.
Her wide silk skirt is so wide across the hips that she has to sidestep through the doorway and the hairstyle on her head almost touches the chandelier of glittering crystal.
She smiles kindly at us and says:
