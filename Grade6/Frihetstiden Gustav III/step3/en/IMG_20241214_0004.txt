The Age of Liberty and Gustav III
We have entered the 18th century.
The period starting now, we usually call the Age of Liberty.
It lasts only about fifty years.
But it is still an important time in our history, even though we no longer win any wars.
Sweden is no longer a great power and has lost many of the territories conquered by the kings in the 17th century.
But Finland is still Swedish.
It's also the end of kings deciding entirely by themselves, as parliament now has more to say.
More and more people are working with things other than farming.
The cities in Sweden are growing, and people are starting to move there.
Merchants send their ships across the globe.
When they return, they bring new and exciting goods like porcelain, silk, and tea.
Year 1720
Fredrik I becomes king but has to share power with parliament.
Year 1741
Sweden starts a war against Russia and loses.
