Substances around us
Where is coal found in nature?
Can we say that oil is a fossil?
What is the difference between rock and mineral?
What is an element?
Do you know any important metals that we humans need?
The ground you stand on is solid, cool, and steady.
But under your feet flows a glowing mass.
At the earth's core, there is a core that is several thousand degrees warm.
It is so warm that the substances there are liquid.
But the earth's crust is cold and hard.
It can stick up like mountain peaks and rocky slabs, but it is often hidden beneath layers of soil or oceans and lakes.
In the earth's crust, there are many substances that we humans want.
We use them for cars, money, jewelry, and in food.
Do you know which substances they are?
