Noble metals
Noble metals are rare and expensive.
They are characterized by being less likely than other metals to form chemical compounds with other substances.
Examples of noble metals are gold, silver, and copper.
Think
Why do you think the winner of a championship gets a gold medal while the runner-up gets silver?
Gold
Gold is a noble metal.
It does not form compounds with other substances.
So one can find pure gold in nature.
Gold is not affected by the weather or even strong acids.
Pure gold is quite soft and easy to shape.
To make it a little harder, alloys with copper or silver are made.
Silver
Silver is also a noble metal.
It is used for jewelry, bowls and silverware, among other things.
However, silver can be affected by other substances.
If you eat eggs with a silver spoon, the spoon turns black.
In the egg, there is sulfur that combines with silver to form a black substance.
Then you have to polish the spoon to make it shiny again.
Platinum
Platinum is a silvery white noble metal.
It is rare and expensive and is used in jewelry and to repair teeth, among other things.
Then and now
Gold and silver can be found as lumps in nature.
They were discovered before other metals, because they could be taken as they were, melted into larger pieces and shaped into whatever was desired.
This was done more than 10,000 years ago in countries that are now Iraq, Iran, and Egypt.
In the deserts of Egypt, gold could be found.
Tutankhamun was an Egyptian pharaoh who lived around 1300 BC.
When archaeologists excavated his tomb in 1922, they found that his coffin was made of pure gold, and the face was covered with a gold mask.
