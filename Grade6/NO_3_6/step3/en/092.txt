The hummingbird makes its way through the flowers and can fly straight up, straight down and even backwards.
Finding food.
There is plenty of food for animals in the rainforest.
The hummingbird is a very small bird that can hover with its rapid wing beats.
It drinks nectar from the flowers.
The chameleon is a lizard that catches insects with its sticky tongue.
It is fast and in less than half a second it has caught its prey.
Many of the rainforest's lizards and snakes are camouflaged to avoid being seen and instead surprise their prey.
In the rainforests of Madagascar, there is a lemur called the aye-aye.
It specializes in eating larvae under the tree bark.
To find the larvae, it listens with its large ears.
With its extra-long finger, it can then pick out the larvae from their tunnels.
In the rainforest, there are also several species of carnivorous plants.
The pitcher plant is a plant with trapping leaves, into which flies fall.
Then a strong liquid dissolves the fly so that the plant can absorb the nutrients.
Rafflesia grows on the ground in the rainforest.
It has the world's largest flower, which is a meter wide with petals that are two centimeters thick.
By smelling like rotten meat, it attracts flies that help pollinate it.
