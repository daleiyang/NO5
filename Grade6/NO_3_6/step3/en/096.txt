Human needs and impact
We humans are a part of life on earth, and the earth's different nature types are also used by humans.
We need land for cities, roads, and cultivation, and pastures for our livestock.
We are inventive, and therefore we have been able to exploit and change large parts of nature.
But when we change an environment, we affect the organisms that live there.
In order to keep as many different species as possible on earth, different types of nature and environments must be preserved.
Pastures
Pastures have existed for a long time.
Many pastures and meadows have become like a kind of mini-steppe with many herbs and grasses that otherwise would not be there.
There has been great biological diversity in the pastures.
But with modern agriculture, many species are disappearing.
Animals are allowed to graze on cultivated fields instead, and the old pastures grow over.
Fertilizers are spread to increase the amount of food available for livestock.
Many of the old pasture plants do not tolerate artificial fertilizers and are pushed aside.
Cultivation areas
The areas that are fields, pastures, and meadows would have been deciduous forests or steppes if we hadn't started using them.
Some cultivation areas are located on drained marshlands.
Draining such lands can affect the groundwater around.
In fields, we often grow only one plant species at a time.
In the past, there were plenty of other plants that used the fields, but now we see them only as weeds.
We combat the weeds by spraying the fields with poison that kills the weeds, or by cleaning the seeds very carefully.
This reduces the number of species.
Humans are changing nature and using land for roads and other purposes.
What do you think it looked like here before it became farmland?
