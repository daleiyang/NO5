Coniferous forests
In the northern hemisphere, in our latitudes, coniferous forests dominate.
They are called taiga after the Russian word for forest.
Here, the seasons change, and winters are snowy.
In winter, tree growth stops, but in summer they grow.
It is a tough climate, and the forest grows slowly.
The needles are protected by a wax layer that allows them to withstand both winter cold and summer heat.
The trees in the coniferous forest grow densely and create an environment that protects against cold winds and large temperature fluctuations.
There are also some deciduous trees in the taiga, such as birch and rowan.
On the ground grow ferns and shrubs, such as blueberries and lingonberries.
Mosses and lichens thrive in the shade.
They quickly absorb moisture and rain and help keep the humidity even in the forest.
In a coniferous forest, there are certainly many plants and animals in number, but there are not particularly many different species.
Adapt to the environment
To cope with the winter cold, animals in the coniferous forest adapt in various ways.
Many small creatures survive the winter as eggs or pupae.
Some spiders and butterflies spin protective cocoons around their eggs and hide them in bark crevices or in the ground.
Some larvae are deep inside the conifer wood.
Voles can make tunnels in the snow, and the fox digs a den in the ground.
Some birds migrate south in winter.
In the coniferous forest, decomposition is slow, creating a thick layer of reserve nutrients in the soil.
There are also many fungi, which are important decomposers.
But earthworms do not thrive in the coniferous forest because the soil is acidic.
