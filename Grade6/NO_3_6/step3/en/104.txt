Reproduction without males and females
All living things can reproduce.
There are different types of reproduction.
There are plants that can reproduce by a part of the plant forming a new plant.
This method of reproduction is called cloning.
The plant has made a copy of itself.
A strawberry plant sends out runners.
On each runner sits a small plant, a copy of the mother plant.
If you like the strawberries the mother plant gives, you should cut off the runner and plant it in the soil where you want a new strawberry plant next year.
The runner takes root and produces the same type of strawberries as the mother plant next year.
The common grasses, including reed and couch grass, send out root shoots to reproduce, in the same way as the strawberry plant.
Many plants can reproduce asexually with root shoots and sexually with flowers.
For example, the strawberry plant can do this.
Reproduction
When plants and animals reproduce and pass life on to new generations, it is called reproduction.
Another word is reproduction.
A common trick to get more seedlings of your favorite houseplant is to take a cuttings.
This means taking a part of the plant and placing it in a new pot.
It takes root and grows into a new plant.
