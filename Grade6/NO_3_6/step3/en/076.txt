Biological diversity
Biological diversity is a term that means there are many different species and that there is great variation in nature and among all living things.
The fact that there are so many species on our planet is the result of several billion years of development.
Several million years ago, there were different animals and plants, and in a distant future, plant and animal life will probably look different.
Over all these millions of years, different forms of life have emerged, many have evolved, and many have disappeared.
So it will always be.
We don't know exactly how many different species of plants and animals exist now.
Every year new ones are discovered.
So far, we humans have described and named about 1.7 million different species.
We have probably found most of the mammals and birds, but there are certainly many plants and insects left to discover.
Stinkbugs use a foul odor and a frightening appearance to scare away enemies.
There are plants and animals in all types of nature.
