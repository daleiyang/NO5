Take care of their young
The killer whale is a mammal.
When a killer whale has a young one, it suckles it for over a year.
The young one usually becomes over eight years old before the mother has a new young one.
Killer whales live in groups together in the seas and are led by the oldest female.
The group helps each other to take care of each other.
The younger ones learn to hunt from the older ones, and everyone takes care of the young in the group.
It is common for killer whales to stay in the same pod for life.
The earwig is an insect that takes good care of its eggs.
When the female has laid the eggs, she often stays there, turns, cleans, and ensures that the eggs are well cared for.

They stay with their mother in the nest during the initial period.
The sea turtle lays its eggs on land, in a pit in the sand.
When the eggs hatch, the mother is far away, and the small young ones must fend for themselves immediately.
It is a dangerous journey for the young ones from the pit down to the sea.
They can easily become prey for other animals.
The young ones that are females and survive will later return to lay their own eggs on the very beach where they themselves hatched.
The albatross is a large sea bird that lives near the South Pole.
It lays an egg every other year.
