The iron ore is enriched
In the mine, the rock is crushed so that it is easier to sort out stones that one does not want.
Since magnetite is magnetic, a large magnet can be used to sort out the parts that contain magnetite.
Stones that do not contain iron do not stick to the magnet.
This is called ore enrichment.

Blast furnaces sort
To obtain pure iron, the oxygen, oxide, must be removed.
This happens in large hot furnaces called blast furnaces.
There, magnetite is heated together with coal and limestone.
The coal combines with the oxygen and forms the gas carbon dioxide, which leaves the blast furnace.
The remaining metal is iron, which is tapped from the blast furnace in molten form.
Waste products that do not contain iron clump together with the limestone and are called slag.
The iron produced now is called pig iron and can be used to cast things.
But often one wants a harder and more malleable material, which can be used to make cars, machinery, and construction materials.
Then even more carbon is removed.
This is called refining and transforms the iron into steel.

Alloys
There is a problem with iron.
When it is exposed to moist air or rain, iron reacts with the oxygen.
Then rust forms and the iron disintegrates.
To prevent rust attack, iron can be mixed with other metals.
It acts as a rust protection.
When metals are mixed with each other or with other substances, it is called an alloy.
Stainless steel is an alloy of iron and nickel or iron and chromium.
Steel is everywhere, for example in bridges, cranes, metal roofs, cars, houses, thermoses, and tools.
