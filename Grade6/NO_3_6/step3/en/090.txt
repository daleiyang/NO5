Rainforests
Around the equator, where the climate is warm and humid all year, grow dense forests called tropical rainforests.
At regular intervals, heavy downpours occur, and it rains at least 2000 mm per year.
The water flows into large rivers.
Along the riverbanks, there are dense, impenetrable thickets.
In this moisture and heat, everything grows very quickly.
The trees become enormously large, and the canopies form different layers, like floors in the forest.
Since the foliage forms dense green roofs, almost no light can penetrate to the ground.
With such quantities of leaves, one might think that the soil layer is thick, but there is almost no soil in the rainforest.
As soon as a leaf drifts down to the ground, the decomposers begin their work.
The main decomposers of the rainforest are springtails and fungi.
In just a few hours, the leaf is gone.
It has quickly become new nutrients dissolved in the water and absorbed by the plants' roots.
The rainforests are very old, and many different species of plants and animals have developed here.
More than half of all the earth's land-dwelling plant and animal species are found there, including 25,000 different orchid species.
In an area the size of a football field, there are about 100 different kinds of trees.
In all of Sweden, we have a total of about 20 different species.
The foliage is so dense that almost no light can penetrate.
But the bat finds its way even in darkness.
For the trees to have a good hold, when there is no soil to anchor the roots in, they can have enormous buttress roots for support.
