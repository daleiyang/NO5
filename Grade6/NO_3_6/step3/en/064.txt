Rock types
The bedrock consists of different types of rock, such as granite, gneiss and limestone.
A rock consists of minerals.
Substances in the Earth's crust
In nature, there are very few pure elements.
Almost all are part of chemical compounds.
The solid mass in the Earth's crust is called bedrock.
In the bedrock, there are many different chemical compounds called rocks.
Most contain oxygen, which is the most common element in the Earth's crust.
Free oxygen is a gas that we breathe and cannot see.
But in the bedrock, oxygen atoms bond with other atoms to form substances we can see.
Granite is a common type of rock composed of many different minerals.
Stones look different depending on the type of rock they are made from.
Stones near water are often smooth because they have been eroded by the water.
Limestone is found in the bedrock of, among other places, Ã–land and Gotland.
It has formed in warm seas and often contains fossils.
Limestone consists of the mineral calcite, which contains carbon.
