Human reproductive organs
Biologically, we humans are like all other mammals, meaning we have internal fertilization.
To reproduce, both females and males must produce sex cells.
Most mammals have a specific time of year, the mating season, when mating occurs.
We humans do not have that.
The advantage of the mammalian rutting season is that the animals' young have time to grow up before the harsh winter.

The male reproductive organ is called the penis.
In men, the sex cells are formed in the testicles.
About 300 million sperm cells can be formed here every day.
The testicles are in the scrotum, a small pouch of skin that hangs outside the body.
The reason for this is that the temperature in the scrotum is lower than inside the body.
More sperm stay healthy and active if it's not too warm when they are formed.
In the prostate and seminal vesicle, mucus that surrounds the sperm is produced.
The mucus provides the sperm with nutrients and a good environment to live in.
Mucus and sperm together form semen, which is also called sperm.
When boys get a bit older and reach puberty, they can have erections and ejaculation so that sperm comes out.
An erection is when the penis is hard.
It happens when the man is sexually aroused and the erectile tissues in the penis fill with blood.
Both erection and ejaculation can also occur during sleep.
At the tip of the penis is the glans.
Nerves are especially dense there, making it sensitive to touch.
Surrounding the glans is a protective skin, the foreskin.
