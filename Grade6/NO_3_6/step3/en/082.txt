Decomposition
The soil in the deciduous forest is fertile, porous, and mixed.
It is the earthworms that mix the soil when they dig their tunnels.
Earthworms eat fallen leaves and their droppings then become new and very nutritious soil.
This is called decomposition.
Deciduous forests
South of the large coniferous forests there is a belt of deciduous forest.
The trees found here are called noble deciduous trees.
These include oak, lime, elm, beech, ash, and maple.
The appearance of the forest varies with the seasons.
In spring, the buds and newly unfolded leaves make the forest look light green.
In summer it is green, and in autumn the foliage glows in shades of yellow and red.
Winters are cold and the trees shed their leaves to withstand the cold.
Shrubs also grow in the deciduous forest, such as hazel and elderberry.
If the forest is not too dense, different grasses and herbs also grow there.
Adapt to the environment
In summer, it can become quite shaded in a dense deciduous forest.
Therefore, many herbs on the ground are spring plants, like the wood anemone.
It blooms before the leaves have unfolded, so that the sunâ€™s rays reach the ground.
In winter, when it gets cold, some animals hibernate, such as mice, hedgehogs, snakes, and lizards.
They eat a lot of food before crawling into their winter hiding places.
In this way, they have reserve nutrition for the entire winter.
The tree roots can go deep into the fertile soil of the deciduous forest.
