Adapt to the environment
Plants that need sunlight are higher up among the branches of the trees.
Here orchids, ferns, and lianas crowd in, because here they get sunlight.
To reach the vital light, there are trees that grow extremely tall.
They grow as small "islands" high above the uppermost layer.
Many animals also live high in the treetops.
Birds and bats can fly.
Those that don't have that ability can instead slither, like snakes, or climb and swing, like monkeys.
The sloth hangs upside down in the branches.
The flying gecko lizard lives its entire life up in the trees.
As an egg, it is stuck to a tree trunk.
The adult lizard spreads two large flaps of skin along its belly and spreads its feet with flaps of skin.
It can then sail twenty meters between two trees.
Some animals are adapted to see better in the dark, so they can hunt at night.
An example is the tarsier, which has enormously large eyes.
The anteater in the Amazon rainforest searches for insects on the ground.
