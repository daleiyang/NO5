Like all ratites, the Australian emu cannot fly.
Instead, it runs fast on its strong long legs.
In the grasslands of Australia, kangaroos hop around in large groups.
The female protects her young by carrying it in the pouch on her belly.
Escape from enemies
The antelopes on the savanna are hunted by cheetahs.
The cheetah is very fast, but not as enduring as the antelope.
When the antelope is chased, it zigzags to shake off its pursuer.
The zebras' striped fur is easy to spot.
But when they are many in a herd and move around, it is annoying for predators.
They find it difficult to focus on which prey to take.
The stripes also protect against insects, like horseflies, which more often target animals with dark fur.
Defend their young
The female rhinoceros stands over her young to defend it from hungry lions and other predators.
Even savannah buffaloes are good at defending their young.
They live in prides and when cheetahs or lions attack a cub, the mother fights and struggles for her cub.
It is not easy for predators to take a buffalo calf.
