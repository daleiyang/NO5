She
Most of the female genitalia are not visible from the outside but are located inside the body.
The female genitalia are called the vagina or slida.
The visible parts are the clitoris and the inner and outer labia, which both surround the vaginal opening.
The clitoris is sensitive to touch because the nerves are close together there.
When a woman becomes sexually aroused, the erectile tissues in the clitoris fill with blood and the vagina becomes moist.
The female reproductive cells are called eggs and are formed in the ovaries, which are two glands the size of walnuts.
The vagina is the canal that leads to the uterus.
The vagina is very elastic and can expand enough for a child to be born.
