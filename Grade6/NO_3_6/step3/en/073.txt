Concepts
enrich: to separate stone with high iron content from stone without iron
atom: one of nature's smallest building blocks
geological formation: consists of one or more types of minerals.
Gneiss, granite and limestone are common rock types in Sweden.
biofuel: biological fuel, for example wood.
It is considered a renewable fuel because the carbon stored in trees is part of a cycle.
open-pit mine: a place where ore is extracted by digging and blasting from the surface
fossil fuels: fuels that have formed in the earth over a very long time, such as oil, coal, and natural gas
refining: to reduce the amount of carbon in iron to make it more pliable
element: a substance that consists only of one type of atom
chemical symbol: an abbreviation of the substance's Greek or Latin name.
Oxygen is called oxygen and is denoted O.
chemical compound: a substance that consists of more than one type of atom
alloy: a mixture of a metal and another substance
ore: rock that contains a metal that can be extracted, for example iron
blast furnace: a furnace where iron is extracted from iron ore
mineral: chemical compound that can be part of a rock
greenhouse effect: the atmosphere acts like a greenhouse and prevents heat from escaping into space
recycle: manage materials and use them again
noble metal: a metal that rarely reacts with other substances
