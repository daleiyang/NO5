DDifferent substances.
The whole universe is made up of different substances.
Substances exist as elements or in various chemical compounds.
All substances have different properties.
They can be light or heavy, they can be liquid, solid, or gaseous.
Some are soluble in water.
They have different colors and can have a special smell.
Some can conduct electricity.
They can melt and boil at different temperatures.
Some substances can be corrosive.
Can you describe any substances in your proximity?
Atoms.
Everything is built of atoms.
An atom is so small that we cannot see it.
About a hundred trillion atoms fit in a single tiny grain of sand.
The atom has a nucleus made up of small particles, protons and neutrons.
Substances can have different numbers of particles in the nucleus, and that number determines which substance it is.
Hydrogen is the smallest atom of all with just one particle in the nucleus.
The carbon atom is much larger and has twelve particles in its nucleus.
Even smaller particles orbit around the nucleus.
Elements.
An element is a substance where all the atoms are of the same kind.
The most common elements in the universe are hydrogen and helium.
But there are more than a hundred different elements.
Examples of elements:.
hydrogen.
oxygen.
carbon.
gold.
When several atoms join together, it is called a molecule.
Atom.
Atom means "indivisible" in Greek.
This was because it was believed that an atom was the smallest building block there was.
Today we know that it is not so.
An atom consists of three types of particles.
In the nucleus of the atom, there are protons and neutrons.
Electrons orbit around the nucleus at an enormous speed.
They move in different orbits, called shells.
But most of an atom is empty space.
