The tiger manages to live in different climates and habitats.
There are several subspecies of tiger, such as Siberian, Bengal, and Caspian tigers, which differ in size and fur, among other things.
Today, several subspecies are extinct, and the tiger is endangered.
The last Caspian tiger died in the 1970s.
As humans have expanded, tigers have been displaced and tiger hunting has reduced their numbers.
Today, tigers remain in only a few countries in Asia.
Most endangered bird species live in the rainforest.
The blue-and-yellow macaw is found in the rainforests of South America.
When forests are cleared for more farmland, the macaws have decreased in number.
Another reason it is threatened is that it is a popular cage bird.
The macaw is easy to tame and can learn to "talk".
It can mimic sounds but doesn't understand the words it has learned to say.
There are several different species of rhinoceros.
The rarest of them is the Javan rhinoceros, which lives on the island of Java in Indonesia.
Despite being an endangered species for a long time, hunting has continued.
The rhinoceros horn is highly sought after.
From the horn, one can make knife handles and ornaments.
The horn is also ground up and sold as medicine and health products.
Poaching has led to this rhinoceros species disappearing from places where it used to live, and today, only a few remain in Java.
