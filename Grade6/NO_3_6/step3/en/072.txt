Metals in the body
MAGNESIUM
Necessary for the structure of the skeleton and for muscles, nerves, and cells to function.
The body consists of about 65 percent water.
But we also have some metals in the body.
About 4 percent of our weight is composed of metals.
We ingest the metals through food.
They are absorbed by the blood in the small intestine and then transported to where they are needed.
We need quite a lot of calcium, iron, magnesium, and sodium.
We only need small amounts of other metals, such as copper, cobalt, manganese, and zinc.
They are called trace elements.
We do not know exactly what functions all trace elements have, but we know that they are necessary for us to feel well.
Chromium
Is good for blood sugar.
IRON
Necessary for blood to be able to transport oxygen to all cells.
Also part of our muscles.
ZINC
Is important for the body's tissues and for forming enzymes.
CALCIUM
Necessary for building up teeth and bones, and for muscles and nerves to function.
It is also needed in the blood, to form scabs.
Copper
Needed for children to grow, for brain development and the immune system.
Part of a substance called melanin that causes us to tan.
Sodium
Is found in all our bodily fluids.
Included in salt (sodium chloride).
