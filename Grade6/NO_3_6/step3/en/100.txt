Some Swedish specialists.
The white swallow-wort grows on rocky shores.
To avoid being eaten, it has a poison and an unpleasant taste.
The lygaeus equestrisis poisonous.
It gets the poison from the common thyme it feeds on.
It tolerates the poison, absorbs plant sap and uses the poison for its defense.
The strong colors red and black act as a warning signal.
One who has tried to eat a lygaeus equestrisis does not do it again.
The firebug is another bug that is also black and red.
It gets its food from mallows and linden trees and is not poisonous.
But the warning colors deter enemies from eating it.
It deceives!
This trick is common in nature and is called mimicry (protective resemblance).
The glowworm is actually a beetle.
The females are wingless and at night they emit a kind of fluorescent light.
They shine like small dots in the bushes.
The light attracts males.
The antlion is actually a dragonfly larva.
It lies hidden in the sand in a pit and waits.
Only the large jaws protrude.
When an ant gets too close to the pit, it slides down, and the antlion throws sand grains on it so it can't escape.
Then the antlion catches its prey lightning-fast.
