The nature of Europe. Europe's nature is diverse. 
It is said that there are five different types of nature in Europe. 
Look at the map to see where the different types of nature are located.
Tundra. In the far north is the tundra. 
This is an area where it is cold all year round. 
In summer, the ground thaws only on the surface. 
On the tundra, only mosses, lichens and grasses thrive.
Taiga. South of the tundra is a large area of coniferous forest known as the tajga. 
Tajgan extends mainly across Sweden, 
Finland and Russia In the taiga, conifers such as spruce, pine and larch grow.
Deciduous forest. South of Tajga is a deciduous forest. 
Deciduous trees such as oak, elm and beech grow there. 
Since the soil where the deciduous forest grows is fertile, people have often cleared the forest.
Today there are large fields and pastures here.
Steppe. East of the deciduous forest belt is the steppe. 
A steppe is a large and dry grassy plain, where some shrubs grow in addition to grass.
Maquis shrubland. In some places around the Mediterranean.
there are areas of dry scrub heath, left by the clearing of forests and the grazing of sheep and goats.
