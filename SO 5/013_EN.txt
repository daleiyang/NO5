The Nordic countries. What is the difference between the Nordics and Scandinavia?

The Nordic region is located in northern Europe. 

The Nordic countries include Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Iceland, as well as the autonomous territories of Åland, the Faroe Islands and Greenland.

Åland is actually part of Finland, while the Faroe Islands and Greenland belong to Denmark.

If you only look at Greenland geographically, the island belongs to North America.

But politically, Greenland belongs to Denmark. Otherwise, Greenland is self-governing.

Sometimes people talk about the Scandinavian peninsula. 

This includes Norway and Sweden, but also north-western Finland.

Scandinavia or the Scandinavian countries usually includes Norway, Sweden and Denmark, but not Finland.

If you use the name Fennoscandia, however, it includes not only the Scandinavian countries but also Finland and a small part of north-western Russia.
