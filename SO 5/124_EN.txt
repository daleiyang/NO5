GEOGRAPHY OF EUROPE 1

NON-RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES
- Fossil fuels

Oil, coal and gas are fossil fuels.

They were formed a very long time ago by
dead plants and animals, which have been pressed together
in the earth's crust.

Oil and natural gas are extracted by drilling deep into the bedrock or the seabed.

At sea, large platforms are used from which the actual drilling takes place.

Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia are the countries in the world that extract the most oil.

In Europe, Great Britain and Norway have large reserves of both oil and natural gas under the seabed in the North Sea.

China is the country that produces the most coal in the world. In Europe, a lot of coal is mined in Germany, Poland, Russia and Ukraine.

Coal is mined in mines or open pits. In an open-pit mine, coal is mined directly at the surface of the earth without digging any tunnels underground.

Oil is the energy source that we use the most.

This is mainly due to the fact that petrol is made from oil. The petrol is needed for all cars in Europe.

A major disadvantage when we use oil, gas and coal is that we affect the environment.
