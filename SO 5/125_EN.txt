RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES. Hydroelectric.
You probably already know that the power of water in a rushing river can be converted into electricity.
This takes place in a hydroelectric plant. 
A hydropower plant is an environmentally friendly source of energy.
It produces no dangerous emissions.
But there are disadvantages even with hydroelectric plants.
Building large dams makes big changes in nature.
Natural areas can be put under water, 
people may be forced to move.
and the fish that live in the rivers may find it difficult to get past the hydroelectric plants.

Solar energy. In a solar power plant, all the energy contained in the sun's rays is used.
With the help of large mirrors, you catch the sun's rays.
Heat is then generated which is then converted into electricity.
Nowadays, you can quite often see solar collectors on some roofs.
The solar collectors can e.g. heat the water used in the home.
The solar collectors can also heat the house in which you live.
Electricity can be produced from the movements of the waves.

Wind power. There is energy in the wind when it blows.
A wind turbine can convert this energy into electricity.
A wind turbine has two or three large rotor blades,
which are set in motion when the wind blows.
As the rotor blades spin, they drive a turbine,
which in turn drives a generator that creates electricity.
Wind turbines produce no environmentally hazardous emissions.
But since they provide comparatively little energy, 
you have to build a lot of wind turbines.

Wave power. Tidal power.
In a wave power plant, the movement of the waves in the sea is used to create electricity.
Tidal power plants are used in areas where there is a large difference between ebb and flow.
The movements of the water at ebb and flow are used to produce electricity.
