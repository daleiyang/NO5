Topographic map of the Nordic countries

A map that shows how nature and the landscape look is called a topographic map. 

In the Nordic countries, the landscape is both mountainous and flat. There are plenty of lakes and rivers, but also forests and cultivated land. 

A topographic map uses different colors to show what the landscape looks like.

A mountainous area is usually brown or purple. Yellow color is used to show highlands that are not as mountainous.

Lowlands with forests and cultivated land are usually green. The lowest lying lowland is the darkest green color.

Lakes, rivers and seas are blue. Dark blue color shows that it is deep there, while light blue color shows that it is shallower.

Making your own topographic map

Now you are going to paint your own topographic map. Use a map book.

Turn to a spread that shows the whole of the Nordic region topographically.

When painting, use the right colors for height differences on land

Finally, write out the names of the Nordic countries.
