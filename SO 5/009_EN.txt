The Earth is changing. A glowing ball that has solidified.
From the very beginning, the Earth was a glowing ball.
After several million years, the globe cooled and its surface solidified.
The hard shell that formed around the Earth is called the crust.
Below the crust is the mantle.
Here it is so hot that all the rocks melt. 
The glowing and viscous mass closest to the crust is called magma. 
When magma from the Earth's interior reaches the surface through a volcanic eruption, it is called lava.
Further into the Earth's interior are the outer and inner core. 
The outer core contains liquid iron and nickel. 
The temperature is about 4 000 degrees. 
The inner core also contains iron and nickel. 
But the inner core is solid because of the high pressure. 
The temperature here is about 5 000 degrees.
You could liken the Earth to an orange. 
The Earth's crust would then correspond to the peel of the orange.
The interior of the orange with all the pulp is then the same as the mantle and core of the Earth.
The crust is divided into plates.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a German scientist called Wegener, 
thought that the contours of Africa and Europe seemed to fit well with South America and North America.
But Wegener couldn't prove anything, of course. Africa. South America.
the earth's crust. mantle. outer core. inner core.
The Earth can be compared to an orange.
The peel of the orange corresponds to the earth's crust.
But about 50 years ago, other scientists managed to prove that the Earth was divided into huge plates.
You could say that the plates are floating like large rafts on top of the glowing and viscous magma under the crust.
Today we know that the Earth's crust is divided into seven large plates and about ten smaller plates.
The plates are called continental plates.
