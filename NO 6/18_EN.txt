Dizzying distances

The distance between the Earth and the Moon is 384 000 kilometers. That's about as far as ten revolutions around the Earth. 

Everything else in the universe is so far away that using units of kilometers becomes meaningless. 

This is because the distances in the universe are enormous.

Across the entire universe, there are probably a hundred thousand billion kilometers. 

If you write it in numbers, it becomes a number with at least 23 digits.

To make the distances comprehensible, we need to use other units.

Light years

The highest speed available is the speed of light, 300 000 kilometers per second (km/s). 

You could send a beam of light around the Earth; it would only take a tenth of a second for it to get around. 

This is why light years are used to describe long distances. 

A light year is the distance light can travel in a year, about 950 billion miles.

Shorter distances can be measured in light-hours, light-minutes or light-seconds. 

It takes eight minutes for the sun's rays to reach the Earth. So the distance between the Sun and the Earth is 8 light-minutes.

The distance between the Moon and the Earth is 1.3 light seconds, as it takes 1.3 seconds for light to travel that distance.
