Volcanic eruptions existed before there was life on Earth. 

They still happen today, for example in Iceland where there are also hot springs.

Millions of years ago

How did life begin?

Before there was life on Earth, the landscape was barren. 

There was no oxygen in the air and nothing could grow or live. 

Volcanoes were everywhere, throwing magma high into the air. 

Glowing lava flowed in wide rivers down the sides of the volcanoes. 

Lightning lit up the sky. The thunderstorms seemed never ending. 

Water poured down in torrential downpours, forming warm lakes and oceans. 

It is believed that life was formed by lightning striking the warm water. 

The lightning caused substances in the water to react with each other and form new substances. 

These substances eventually formed the first living cells - the primordial cells. 

This is how scientists believe the first life on Earth came about.

Bacteria - the first life

The very first bacteria were cyanobacteria, very small and simple organisms. 

In some of them, the green dye chlorophyll was formed. 

These bacteria were able to use the chlorophyll and convert carbon dioxide and sunlight into glucose and oxygen, what we call photosynthesis. 

Thanks to cyanobacteria, oxygen was released into the atmosphere.

This was the prerequisite for life on land to exist. 

These bacteria changed over time and became more complex.

Some of these we can see today as algal blooms.

Cyanobacteria live in the sea. During the summer, it is common for them to become visible. 

They cause the warm water to become cloudy. 

This is called an algal bloom, but it is neither algae nor flowers, but bacteria.
