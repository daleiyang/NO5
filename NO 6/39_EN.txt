Concepts

accelerate: to increase speed

circular motion: when something spins around a center point with a force acting towards the center

friction force: the force between two surfaces rubbing against each other

free fall: when something falls freely without resistance

gravitational force: the force of attraction between two bodies, but the word is most often used for the gravitational force of the Earth

speed: the distance you travel in a given time, often expressed as meters per second (m/s) or kilometers per hour (km/h)

speedometer: an instrument that measures speed

force: something that causes something else to move or change shape

average speed: the mean value of the speed maintained by, for example, a car during a journey

counterforce: force that counteracts another force when something moves

Newton (N): unit of force

'motion' means the movement of something

supporting surface: the surface on which an object distributes its weight. 

For a block it is the floor surface towards the bottom of the block, for a chair the floor surface between the legs of the chair is also part of the supporting surface

tide: change in sea level between high tide (flood) and low tide (ebb)

center of gravity: the middle of an object's mass

Do you know now?

What is average speed?
What is it called when something increases in speed?
What is meant by free fall?

Two people jump out of an airplane. Who reaches the ground first? Choose options and give reasons.
a) The one who weighs the most.
b) The one who weighs the least.
c) They fall at the same speed and reach the ground at the same time.

What is a force? Explain with examples.

What is the force that keeps you on the ground called?

What is meant by a tide?

Give examples of when you want as little friction as possible.

Give examples of when you want a lot of friction.
