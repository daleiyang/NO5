Different forces

When a FORMULA 1 car starts, the driver accelerates and the car almost stalls. 
Acceleration is huge in the first few seconds as the car goes from standstill to over 100 km/h. 
These cars can also brake in a matter of seconds. 
This is a major counterforce on the driver, who must be properly restrained.

A PARACHUTE jumper ejects from the aircraft and falls straight down. 
This is called free fall. It is the earth's gravitational force that pulls the parachutist down towards the ground. 
When you're falling for so long, your speed won't keep increasing. 
This is because the air slows down and you reach a so-called limit speed. 
This means that the parachutist cannot fall faster than a certain speed. 
As soon as the parachute deploys, the air resistance increases and the speed decreases.

VELODROME CYCLING is a cycling sport using lightweight bicycles without brakes. The track is oval and inclined.
The force between the cyclist and the track is then equal to the force towards the center of the circle.

IN BADMINTON, you have to hit a shuttlecock over a net to your opponent. 
A badminton ball is light, but with the stroke you can get it away at an enormous speed.
