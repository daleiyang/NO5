The age of dinosaurs

About 150 million years ago, the time we call the Age of Dinosaurs was going on. 
There were so many different reptiles that they completely dominated animal life. 
The largest land animal that ever lived on Earth existed then: Brachiosaurus. 
This herbivorous dinosaur was 25 meters long, 12 meters high and weighed as much as 30 cars. 
Another dinosaur was the carnivorous Tyrannosaurus rex. 
It walked on its hind legs and could quickly catch up with its prey. 
When it stood up on its hind legs, it reached between six and eight meters high.
With its huge jaws, with saw-toothed teeth two centimeters long, it tore its victim into bite-sized pieces.

In the air were small gliding lizards. 
They climbed into tall trees and could then glide down to the ground. 
Other lizards could fly by moving their wings. 
Some were over eight meters between wingtips, as big as a small airplane. 
They were skilled gliders and could take advantage of the winds. 
They had hair on their bodies but no scales.

These eggs are from an ancestral beaked dinosaur. 
They are from the Jurassic period (135-200 million years ago) and were found in China. 
They were still placed in the nest.
