The outer major planets

Outside Mars, the giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune orbit. 
All are large balls of gas. They have no solid surface, but they probably have a solid core in the middle. 
The planet Jupiter has almost 80 moons of different sizes. Around the planet Saturn you can see several rings -
ice, gravel and boulders spinning around the planet.

Asteroids

There are also lots of boulders of different sizes orbiting the Sun. They are called asteroids. 
Between the planets Mars and Jupiter is an area with a particularly large number of asteroids, known as the asteroid belt.
In the past, asteroids were thought to be the remnants of an exploded planet, but now we are fairly sure that they were never together. 
Sometimes asteroids can come close to the Earth's orbit and even hit the Earth. 
Lake Siljan in Dalarna is actually a water-filled crater from an asteroid impact 400 million years ago.

Saturn is a large gas planet. The rings around the planet are ice and rock rotating around it.

More than 50 000 years ago, an asteroid hit the Earth in Arizona, USA.
The crater that formed has a diameter of 1.3 kilometers and is about 108 meters deep.
