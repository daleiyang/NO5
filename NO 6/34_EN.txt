Frictional force

There are more forces than gravity. One of the forces that we both need and sometimes want to get rid of is the force of friction. 
It is the force between two surfaces rubbing against each other. The friction force slows down, but can also help an object gain speed. 
The amount of friction depends on factors such as the surface and the environment.

Almost all surfaces are uneven. On some surfaces, such as sandpaper or concrete, you can feel it clearly.
Other surfaces may feel smoother, such as ice, polished stones or glass. 
The more uneven a surface is, the greater the friction. It is easier to slide on ice than on concrete.

Sometimes you want to reduce friction

If you've ever kayaked, you know how easily you can increase your speed with just a few strokes.
To make this happen, you want as little friction as possible under the boat.
That's why they build boats with narrow bottoms and pointed prows, so they cut through the waves and glide through the water as smoothly as possible.
When you ride a bike, it's easy to feel the friction caused by air resistance.
Headwinds increase friction even more. Competitive cyclists wear helmets that are specially designed to reduce drag.

On ice, you glide more easily with skates than with shoes. 
The contact area with the ice is much smaller with the blade of the skates, and the blade is shiny and hard. 
This reduces friction against the ice. To improve the glide of your skis, you can put wax on the underside of your skis.

Curling is a sport played on ice. The object of the game is to make a special stone slide on the ice and stay in the nest, in the center of the circle. 
Players sweep brooms in front of the stone to guide it and make it slide further. 
Curlers also wear shoes with a non-slip sole.
