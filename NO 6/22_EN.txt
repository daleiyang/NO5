Instruments for space research

A satellite is something that moves around a celestial body. It can be natural. 

For example, the Moon is a satellite of the Earth and the Earth is a satellite of the Sun.

The space probes orbiting the Earth are man-made satellites. 

They carry instruments and are important for space research. 
There are several satellites at different distances from Earth. 
The closest are about 2000 km above the Earth. 
The furthest ones are almost 40 000 km away. 
When you look up at the sky on a starry night, you can see satellites without binoculars. 
They look like small stars moving quickly across the sky.

Of course, satellites don't shine by themselves, they reflect sunlight.

Solar cells were first used on satellites. They wanted to be able to recharge batteries in space.
