Galaxies

The Universe contains many galaxies of different shapes. Each galaxy contains billions of stars and solar systems. 
Our solar system is located at the outer edge of the Milky Way galaxy. 
Sometimes you can see a white band in the sky with stars shining brighter. 
What you see then is the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way. 
The Milky Way is the English name for the Milky Way.

Stars

A star is a luminous ball of hot gas, including hydrogen and helium. 
At the center of the star, hydrogen is combined into helium, releasing energy.
This process is called fusion and is what creates the energy of the Sun and all other stars.

This is where we live! The Milky Way.
