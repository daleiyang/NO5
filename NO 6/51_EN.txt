Modern humans

During the course of human evolution, there have been several different human species. 
Some lived for shorter periods and others for longer.
One species of human, Homo neanderthalensis, Neanderthals, lived in Europe and Asia 250000 years ago. 
Neanderthals had short, compact bodies and large heads. 
Traces of them have shown that they used simple tools like axes.

About 200000 years ago, small herds of humans roamed the African plains. 
They were a different kind of people. They lived on grass roots that they dug up using sticks. 
They caught insects, small reptiles and small mammals which they ate. 
They could also talk and warn each other of dangers. 
In caves, they painted pictures of animals they had caught in successful hunts. 
They had advanced tools such as sewing needles and harpoons and made jewelry and sculptures. 
They could also use fire.

This was the beginning of the species that now exists on Earth and to which you belong: Homo sapiens, modern humans. 
When Homo sapiens moved north to Europe, Neanderthals were already living there.
But as Homo sapiens spread, Neanderthals disappeared. 
This was around 30000-40000 years ago. It is not known why Neanderthals disappeared. 
Perhaps they were outcompeted by modern humans?

In the Lascaux cave in France, there are cave paintings made almost 20000 years ago. 
Images of animals are common motifs.
