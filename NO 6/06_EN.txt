The universe. Can a star go out? What is a satellite? Is a shooting star really a falling star? What is a leap year?

The Universe is big, quiet and very cold. There are galaxies, stars, planets and gas clouds. There's also you.

Haven't you ever looked up at the night sky and felt quite small? Humans have always looked up at the

the sky and pondered the mysteries of the universe. You yourself have probably marveled at how many stars there are in the sky. 

You'll probably be even more amazed when you learn that there are so many more than you can see. 

They are so far away in the universe that the light does not reach us. 

During the day, you can't see any stars at all because the sky is too bright. Well, you can see one. The sun!
