Planets

Both in the morning and in the evening, a bright point of light is sometimes visible in the sky, like a star. 
It is called the morning star or the evening star. But it's not a star we see, but the planet Venus. 
It is the closest planet to Earth.

Planets are celestial bodies that rotate around a star. 
The Sun is the star around which our own planet, Earth, moves. 
We can see some planets in the night sky without binoculars. 
We perceive them as shining, but they cannot shine by themselves. 
They are visible and appear to glow because they reflect the sun's rays, just like the moon does.

Mars is called the red planet, and it is iron oxide (rust) that gives it its reddish color. 

The inner small planets

Earth is one of eight planets in our solar system. 
Several of the planets have moons that rotate around them, just like Earth. 
Closest to the Sun is the smallest planet, Mercury. 
Beyond it are Venus and Earth, then Mars. 
These four planets have several similarities: they are about the same size, they are made of rock and metal, and they have a solid surface that you can walk on. 
Mars is the planet that is most similar to Earth.
For example, it has areas of ice.
