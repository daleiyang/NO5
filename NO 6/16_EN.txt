Comets

A comet is a large ball of ice and rock that often moves in an oblong orbit around the Sun. 
When the comet is close to the Sun, the ice evaporates. The steam is then visible as a white blurry envelope, like a tail on the comet. 
Each comet is named after its discoverer and in 1996, for the first time, we had a comet named after a Swede - Lagerkvist's comet.

Because comets move around the Sun, they are visible from Earth several times. 
There can be a very long time between them, but you can calculate when it will happen. 
The most famous comet, Halley's Comet, was last seen in 1986. The next time it will be visible is in 2061.

Comet Hale-Bopp was visible from Earth for 18 months in 1996-97.

Meteors and meteorites

Sometimes we think we see shooting stars - a small star falling down in the sky. 
But what we see are not stars, they are space rocks that burn up as they fall through the Earth's atmosphere. 
For example, they could be the remains of an asteroid that has crashed and broken up. 
Such space rocks are called meteors. Meteors have tremendous speed, but as they approach Earth they are slowed down by the atmosphere. 
They then heat up and start to burn, just as a match does when you strike it against the ash. 
Meteors are particularly common in the fall and winter. They often come in showers, meteor showers, sometimes several a minute. 
Large meteors don't always have time to burn up in the air, but hit the Earth's surface. They are then called meteorites.
