Dividing one number by another number is called division.
The two numbers are called the numerator and denominator. The answer is called quotient.
numerator. quotient. denominator.
DIVISION WHEN THE NUMERATOR'S FIRST NUMBER IS LESS THAN THE DENOMINATOR.
Here we show how to calculate short division when the first digit of the numerator is a smaller number than the number in the denominator.
1 hundreds divided by 2 is O hundreds. You do not need to print the zero.
13 tens divided by 2 is 6 whole tens.
The remaining 1 tens becomes a memory digit and corresponds to 10 singulars.
12 singulars divided by 2 is 6 singulars.
DIVISION WHEN THE NUMBER IS A NUMBER IN DECIMAL FORM.
Short division can also be used when dividing numbers in decimal form.
6 tens divided by 2 is 3 tens.
5 singular divided by 2 is 2 whole singular. The remainder 1 singular = 10 tenths.
Print the decimal point in the quotient as you pass it.
14 tenths divided by 2 is 7 tenths.
How can you be sure that you have placed the decimal point correctly?
A good way is to use rough calculations.
In this example, you can think like this.
65 is slightly more than 60 and 60 divided by 2 is 30. Then the answer must be 32.7.
