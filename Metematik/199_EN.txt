The European holiday.
The Persson family lives in Oskarshamn.
Last summer they went on a driving holiday in northern Europe.
The family consists of mother Jelena, her partner Håkan and children Erik and Alva.
This episode is about that journey.
The first day they drove from Oskarshamn to Trelleborg.
It was 35 miles. How many kilometers is it?
The ferry to Travemände left at quarter to twelve at night.
Alva wondered if a digital clock showed 12.45 then, but Erik said it showed 00.45.
Were either of them right?
The ferry arrived at Travemände at 07.30. How long did the trip take?
They took the freeway south.
Outside Hamburg there was road work and they drove in a queue for three hours.
Now we have maintained an average speed of just 8 kilometers per hour, said Håkan.
How far did they drive in the queue?
Erik tried to explain to Alva what is meant by mean value.
As an example, he calculated the average age of the family.
What value did Erik arrive at if Håkan was 42 years old, Jelena 40 years old, Alva 9 years old and Erik 13 years old?
