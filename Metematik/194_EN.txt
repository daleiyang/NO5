Division by 10, 100 and 1,000.
DIVISION OF NUMBERS IN DECIMAL FORM.
When dividing a number in decimal form by 10,
all digits in the number will get a 10 times smaller value.
The tens digit becomes the ones digit, the ones digit becomes the tenths digit and so on.
This means, for example, that 14.5/10 = 1.45.
The numbers move as many steps to the right as there are zeros in 10.
hundreds. ten. singular. tenth. hundredth.
If we instead divide 14.5 by 100, all the digits in the number will get a 100 times smaller value.
We then get that 14.5/100 = 0.145.
The numbers move as many steps to the right as there are zeros in 100.
Since the numbers move two steps, we must add a zero and write 14.5 as 014.5.
One or more zeros at the beginning of the number does not change the value of the number.
Here, for example, the digit 1 moves from the tens position to the tenths position.
hundreds. ten. singular. tenth. hundredth. thousandth.
Similarly, we can show that 14.5/1000 = 0.0145.
The numbers move as many steps as there are zeros in 1,000.
Since the numbers move three steps, we can add some zeros and write 14.5 as 0014.5.
The leading zeros do not affect the value of the number.
