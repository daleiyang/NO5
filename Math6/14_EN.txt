a) 47,8 +8,35 b) 46,03 - 13,58



a) 47 80 Write the terms to the same number of decimal places before doing the calculation.



To see if the answer is reasonable, you can do an extrapolation. 



You will get 50 + 10 = 60. The answer is therefore reasonable.



b) 46,03 - 13,58



3 hundredths minus 8 hundredths is not possible, so you have to convert down.



Change down 1 singular to 10 tenths.



Then change down I of these tenths to hundredths.



Answers: a) 56.15, b) 32.45
