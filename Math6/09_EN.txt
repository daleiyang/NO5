COMPARE NUMBERS



The further to the right on a number line a number is, the bigger the number is.



For example, 2 is a bigger number than -3 and -5 is a smaller number than -1.



We can write it like this:



2>-3 



The sign > means “is greater than”. .



-5<-1



The < sign means “is less than”



The < and > signs are examples of inequality signs.



NUMBERS IN DECIMAL FORM



In a pole vault competition, Armand Duplantis jumped 6.15 m. 



The number 6.15 is an example of a number in decimal form. 



We read the number as “six whole and fifteen hundredths” or “six point fifteen”.



The numbers 1 and 5 after the decimal point are called decimals.



PLACE VALUES



The place value of a digit depends on its place in the number, its position. 



Such a number system is called a position system.



An old event in athletics is the mile run. 



This is 1609.344 m long. In that number, the digit 6 has the value 600 and the digit 3 has the value 0.3.



thousandth digit that has the value 1 * 1000 = 1000



hundredth digit that has the value 6 * 100 = 600



tens digit having the value 0 * 10 = 0



one-digit number with the value 9 * 1 = 9



tenth digit having the value 3 * 0.1 = 0.3



hundredths digit having the value 4 * 0.01 = 0.04



thousandth digit having the value 4 * 0.001 = 0.004
