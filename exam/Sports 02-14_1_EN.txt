WHAT IS HEALTH?
The word health refers to how one feels overall.
The World Health Organization has written out the meaning of the word health as follows.
Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being.
and not merely absence of disease and weakness.
This quote means that the best health you can have does not only mean that you are healthy and injury-free, but also that you have to feel good physically in your body,
feeling happy and that what you do has meaning and that you enjoy being with your friends and family.
Having "perfect" health is an almost impossible mission.
but you should strive to feel as good as possible.
